"They can hate if they wanna
I don't care, yeah
I said let them hate if they wanna
Goin' nowhere
(What you know about a stereotype? Hey)
They can hate if they wanna
Let them hate if they wanna
Goin' nowhere

[Verse 1]
Mmm, all your friends keep sayin' you can do better
With somebody else (Hey, come on)
Sayin' I'm dangerous and you can do bad
All by yourself (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Everybody got somethin' to say)
And they don't even wanna see
While they talk so badly
I actually make you happy
(All that matter is us anyway)
And I don't even give a damn
For you I'm a better man
So tell 'em, if they wanna hate, they can
You might also like[Chorus]
Let them talk about us
(They can hate if they wanna)
I don't care
(I don't care)
No matter what they say about us
(Let them hate if they wanna)
We ain't goin' nowhere
(Goin' nowhere)

[Verse 2]
Mmm, everybody says you're too slow for me
And the life I live
You ain't out in the club all night
You wanna be the quiet part of my life
They don't understand how beautiful that is, hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
(Everybody got somethin' to say)
They don't even wanna see
While they're talkin' so badly
I actually make you happy, and all that matters
(All that matter is us anyway)
And I don't even give a damn
For you I'm a better man
So tell 'em, if they wanna hate, they can
[Chorus]
Let them talk about us
(They can hate if they wanna)
I don't care
(I don't care)
No matter, no matter what they say about us

We ain't goin' nowhere
(I ain't goin', I ain't goin' nowhere, no)

[Bridge]
Let them hate if they wanna
I don't care (I don't care, no, no, no, no)
No matter what they believe
Ain't goin' nowhere
(Listen, I think I'll say it again, say it again, say it again, say it again)
Let them hate if they wanna
(Oh, let them hate)
I don't care
(Oh, let them hate on us if they want to)
No matter what, baby, we ain't goin' nowhere
(It could be, it could be you and me against the world, baby)

[Chorus]
Let them talk about us

"Let Me Know Lyrics[Intro]
I turn the other way
I'll never turn you down
You turn me on
Don't speak out every meaning
I don't belong to you
You don't belong to me
So don't hold on too tightly

[Chorus]
Let me know when you're lonely, babe
Let me know when you're lonely, babe

[Verse 1]
Happier now than I've been in the past
Gone are the days
Gone are the tears
That was a girl I used to be
The girl that you now see standing in front of you
Could keep going on
Because she believes
In setting you free

[Chorus]
So let me know when you're lonely, babe
Let me know when you're lonely, baby
Let me know when you're lonely, babe
Let me know when you're lonely, baby

I turn the other way
I can never turn you down
You turn me on
Don't speak out every meaning
I don't belong to you
Like you don't belong to me
So don't hold on too tightly
Let forever be

[Chorus]
So let me know when you're lonely, babe
Let me know when you're lonely, baby
Let me know when you're lonely, babe
Let me know when you're lonely, baby
Let me know when you're lonely, babe (It might be sweet)
Let me know when you're lonely, baby (If we could meet)
Let me know when you're lonely, babe (Along the way)
Let me know when you're lonely, baby (That could be okay)

[Bridge]
They're all the same in this cynical age
I won't be your ball and chain
I risk my reputation
Just to get a room
You always have the reservation
So come lie down beside me
(So let me know when you're lonely, babe)
(Let me know when you're lonely, baby) Beside me
(Let me know when you're lonely, babe) Beside me
(Let me know when you're lonely, baby) Beside me
[Chorus]
So let me know when you're lonely, babe (It might be sweet)
Let me know when you're lonely, baby (If we could meet)
Let me know when you're lonely, babe (Along the way)
Let me know when you're lonely, baby (That could be okay)

[Outro]
That could be okay
It might be sweet
If we could meet
Along the way
That could be okay1Embed","Let me know I'm here for you\nI love you, baby\nOh, baby\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm waiting for you\nI know you're waiting\nI can't make a sound if you're not here\nAnd you know I'm waiting for you\nI know I'm waiting for you\nI can't make a sound if you're not here\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nSo come on now\nMy baby, when your face is blue"
