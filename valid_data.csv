Jaill,The Stroller,neg,"1 ContributorThe Stroller LyricsThere's cracks in the structure I swear baby get out
Tire tracks in the basement to what you might fall

You didn't try cashin' in
That's not my fault

Where are the beggars when I need to look good?
I sure don't want my life as a stroller
And I wouldn't put my life in the hands of a stranger

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

I sure don't want my life as a stroller
And I wouldn't put my life in the hands of a stranger

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

Priestess,Lady Killer,neg,"4 ContributorsLady Killer LyricsTurn the scissors with open blades
All the darkness will burn
Recalling pictures of olden days
All these feelings return
If you're breathing you've been afraid
In the shadows remain
I'll be stalking you night and day
Till you share all my pain

Now we step into the fire

Beware you will pay
Ladykiller
I swear you will pay
Ladykiller

Bait the killer and lie in wait
Till the morning unfolds
Now he's feeding on my mistakes
And the trail has run cold
All the violence that fills the world
Leaving nothing for shame
This is when so much pain will call out
Such things I have learned

Hear my vow and fear my vengeance

Carole King,Will You Love Me Tomorrow?,pos,"19 ContributorsWill You Love Me Tomorrow? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night (When the night)

Brook Benton,Lie To Me,neg,"3 ContributorsLie to Me LyricsI know I'm losing you, I feel it all the time
And I know if I lose you, then I'll lose my mind
So lie to me, lie to me, make me believe everything you say
Just, lie, lie, lie, lie, I'd rather have it that way

Nobody told me you were cheating
Aw it's just a feeling I had
So if I'm right, you got to lie to me
Then I won't feel so bad

Because the truth would only hurt me
And that price is too big to pay
So lie to me, lie to me, I'd rather have it that way

Now you may think I'm foolish for saying what I said
But the truth could mean I'd lose you
So tell me a little lie instead

Tell me that you love me and I'll believe every word you say

Cut to mirror your intention

Down the highway at night
And you're feeling that wild turkey's bite
Don't give Johnny Walker a ride
'Cause Jack Black is right by your side
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find
You've been arrested for driving while blind

[Verse 2]
Now just the other night with nothing to do
We broke a case of proof 102
And started itching for that wonderful feel
Of rolling in an automobile
You could say we was out of our mind
And let me tell you we were flying while blind

[Instrumental Break 0:47-1:29]

[Verse 3]
Then they had us up against the wall
Hey, it's only blood grain alcohol
And there ain't no cause for alarm
We ain't out to do nobody no harm
How could anyone be so unkind
To arrest a man for driving while blind?

Whatever happened to
Saturday Night
When you dressed up sharp
And you felt all right?

It don't seem the same
Since cosmic light
Came into my life
I thought I was divine

I used to go for a ride
With a chick who'd go
And listen to the music
On the radio

A saxophone was blowin'
On a rock 'n' roll show
You climbed in the back seat
Really had a good time

From the perfume I smelt
My hands kinda fumbled with her

I'd taste her baby-pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine

Get back in front
Put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing
His very last song

With your arms around your girl
You try to sing along
You felt pretty good. Woo!
Really had a good time!

Louis Armstrong,What A Wonderful World,pos,"77 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschWhat a Wonderful World Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

[Verse 2]
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

[Bridge]
The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying, ""I love you""

[Verse 3]
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Flashbacks of the times we've had

Stars can't fight city lights
They've turned their backs on us
It's true today, I saw it from the plane
Aeroplanes were never built to fly

Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Don't look down
Don't look now

Crosshairs of our shadow trace the dam
Told that there were people trapped alive
Boulder City looks like coals in the fire

Cabin's perched by satellites
And now we're flying blind
We've got a lady pilot
She's not afraid to die

It's true today, I saw it from the plane
We've almost finished reeling in the sky
Power lines once laced the heavens

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Momma's tellin' me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy

My steeze is gonna be affected

And if my secret dreams could be seen on screen
Then they'll be coming for this one

The first time she ignored me
But then I threw her on the floor

There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

[Chorus]
Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?

Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it?

[Verse 2]
There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
Oh, and I'll make it all worthwhile

Sinead O'Connor,War,neg,"5 ContributorsWar Lyrics[Verse 1]
Until the philosophy
Which holds one race superior
And another inferior
Is finally and permanently
Discredited and abandoned
Everywhere is war

[Verse 2]
Until there is no longer first class
Or second class citizens of any nation
That until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance
Than the color of his eyes
I've got to say ""war""

[Verse 3]
That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Then we say ""war""

[Verse 4]
That until that day the dream of lasting peace
World-citizenship and the rule of
International morality will remain
Just a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never obtained
And everywhere is war

While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain

I'd unravel any riddle

With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain

Oh, I would tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I never thunk before
And then I'd sit and think some more

I would not be just a nuffin'

My heart all full of pain

In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm
May be surrounded by a million people, I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine, baby, how are you?
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another aeroplane, another sunny place
I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home
Mmm, I got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I know just why you could not come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Sitting and wondering why nothing's happening
Everyone was there
In a wooden chair
Doing nothing
Still doing nothing
Drinking, smoking

No one seems to care
In their wooden chair
Doing nothing

I go walking through the park
Underneath a moldy sky
Thinking ""yes I think this place
Would be such a lonely place to die
Such a lonely place to die

Nothing we're doing nothing
Literally frozen stiff from nothing happening
Something has to change
Cause it's no longer feeling strange
To do nothing Ad nauseam nothing
And feeling acutely every millisecond pass
We can ignore that this is sad
Because we know that it all adds up to nothing

'Cause your hope is gone

Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?
Will it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?

Half asleep and self-indulged

Felt like you were hiding something, but I didn't push it
I didn't complain or say nothing
I tried to act like I didn't see it
'Cause deep down, I knew I didn't wanna believe it
There it was, it was you and her, you left your sidekick on the nightstand
And I read

I betray the ones I've come to love the most

And most of all I've had
Has come to get revenge on all I've done

But I'm sad

And our love is far behind

[Verse 1: Myka 9]
Every man for himself, can be difficult, mythical
Typical, critical, pitiful, beautiful, hypocritical, hypothetical
Alpha numerical the Darwinian way, obstacle course fittest survival
Unforgettable, unforgivable
Diabolical lies within the Bible, Unified Field Theory of Love
Ignoramus enlightened to his path and purpose
Creator, preserver, destroyer, curb server
Quantum mechanics converted from bow ties to Mormon
Also a paraplegic, whirling dervish
Pledge of Allegiance backwards
Rocket science nano technology
Awkward moments caught between a rock and a hard place
You're in a sticky situation, zero visibility
Late night radar emergencies passenger pilot
Typhoon, hurricane, broken components
Airstrips, stormy rain, military ship
Landing a plane to Malaysia, amnesia
Indonesia with a squeegee
You were trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents for a ticket to Fiji
With Saturday Night Fever without the Bee Gee's
All the doohickeys and thingamabob's of highly sensitive circuitry
Micro-engineering a blind man behind the wheel steering
Energy equaling matter or mass times the speed of light squared
Foreplay with the Catholic nun, makin' a hoe into a housewife
Making a crack head drop the pipe
Looking at Luke's peep show fully dressed
With a number of angels dancing on a nuclear warhead
Everyone on Earth chanting 'Om...'
Taking bong hits, holding hands, alone
At the same time finding a truly righteous queen in a strip club
Playing patty cakes with heartless thugs
Getting the Fellowship to rehearse for a show
We do reverse to a flow and do a motherfucking overdub

Will take the Milky Way, in a filthy way
And try to dig a whole to China with a spoon
Handcuffed to a thousand pounds of C4, while
Dip to the bottom of the sea floor
Then swim back up to the sea shore

I'll shoot a mango off your head from a mile away
I shot, ran a marathon barefoot and broken glass without a cut
Take my place in the stars, see my face on Mars
Hijack NASA for the shuttle with a .38 inch snubnose
And race the cars, take the negative devil gene out of man
And erase the wars with a straight jacket and a crooked face
And a broken stick shifter, a ceremony for audio-body of
Miracle, spiritual, uplifter
A Siamese twin Libra, connected amoeba
Beautiful, wonderful world without miss moon Makeba
That's impossible like Ethan Hunt

A serial killer, Gandhi
Loveable Hitler, A fiddler on a burning roof

Collard greens boiled with the ham hocks
Sleep in a ham-mock and I flow from the shamrock
And kill ya kill ya with a four lock Glock 9
Supply mine, spreads the landmines

Truthfully, you got a better chance hitting the lottery 15 times in a row
Now you tell me the odd’s on that
You’d rather get head from a wild bobcat
You’d rather slap the chief of police knowing you got 2 strikes
You’d rather run up to the White House with a Bullseye T-Shirt on blasting a starter pistol, yellin' revolution!! revolution!!
You’d rather sky dive butt naked into a field of meat hooks
And bathe in a flammable solution, solution
Holding a Philly overdosing on Heron
You’d rather try to dope fiend Farrakhan
You’d rather walk through a lions den
Wearin' pork chop earrings and cheap top sirloin body oil cologne
You’d rather be fully awake while getting operated on
You got a better chance of going back to the 1920s
As a black transvestite running for president and winning
You’d rather go head up with a swinging wrecking ball
And drugged at a 120 miles through a pavement of 10 inch titanium nails
You’d rather die for what you don’t believe in

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

As I hang the tinsel on the tree and watch the twinkling lights
I'm warmed by the fire's glow
Outside the children tumble in the wonderland of white
And make angels in the snow

But half a world away you try your best to fight the tears
And hope that Heaven's Angels come to carry you here

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul start to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes
And in tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize
I realized I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake

John Pizzarelli,Mountain Greenery,pos,"1 ContributorMountain Greenery LyricsOn the first of May, it is moving day
Spring is here, so blow your job
Throw your job away

Now's the time to trust to your wanderlust
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait

In our mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together

While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet
When it rains, we'll laugh at the weather

And if you're good
I'll search for wood
So you can cook while I stand looking

Beans could get no keener
Reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home

Mosquitoes here
Won't bite you dear
Well, I'll let them sting me on the finger

To tell me which way I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow

Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on
But there's nothing left to show

Only ask and you will get what you are needing

There's stars we can wish upon, at the setting of the sun
The sunsets we can cry over, put our trouble's on the run
But more than all these miracles above, good people, we got love

Everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Just like they need the sun, moon and stars up above

A'int nobody ever found happiness, living their lives all alone
I used to go around like I didn't need nobody, to be me happy and alone
And one sad day I found myself in trouble, way down without a friend
Along came the love of a real good woman, said she'd love me 'til the end

Everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and all the stars up above

Everybody needs love, love, love

Are you ready to take the chance and risk it all?
It's do or die, fight or flight
Do you want to feel alive?
So would you play a game of Russian Roulette
To save your life, are you in, are you in?
Or will you flee to safety, and wonder what could have been?
Don't be afraid, don't ever be afraid
Oh, now you've been hiding, you've been hiding
You've been hiding in the shadows

You're afraid, when you're afraid
Take a chance don't let it weigh you down

Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 2]
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 3]
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head

Phil Perry,If Only You Knew,pos,"2 ContributorsIf Only You Knew LyricsI must have rehearsed my lines a thousand times
Until I had them memorized
But when I get up the nerve to tell you the words
Just never seem to come out right

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

I dreamed of moments we share but you're not there
I'm living in a fantasy
'Cause you don't even suspect, could probably care less
About the changes I've been going through

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do love you

Strike Anywhere,The Promise,neg,"3 ContributorsThe Promise LyricsFour, three, two, one, go!

This is America, yeah, it's true
Everything else is false that was taught to me and you
But I'll try to sort it out
I'll try to sort it out

This is America, yeah, it's true
Everything else is false that was taught to me and you
But I'll try to sort it out
I'll try to sort it out with you

Did you promise the world that you'd change it?
Sounds like the way that I feel
One brick thrown, one vote alone
Won't take back everything they steal

We'll take back everything they steal

This is America, yeah, it's true
Everything else is false that was taught to me and you
But I'll try to sort it out
I'll try to sort it out

Shake it up, shake me 'til I wake from the coma
All the distance, distorted and lonely too
So out of the target
So out of the target, I'm pushing you

Hold my hand
I need you now
Slow me down
I don't know how

Hold my hand
I need you now

Are you living the feeling
The hights are they worth seeking
Nothing like believing
Are your drugs healing

Are you really living
Or do you seek loving
Are you happy being
Or do you search for meaning

Are you ever asking
Questions they need answering
You're not really hearing
You really need releasing

A million pieces broken
A million secrets unspoken
A million pieces broken
A million secrets unspoken

[Chorus]
Hold my hand

Shenandoah,I Want To Be Loved Like That,pos,"3 ContributorsI Want To Be Loved Like That LyricsNatalie Wood gave her heart to James Dean
High school rebel and the teenage queen
Standing together in an angry world
One boy fighting for one girl

I want to be loved like that
I want to be loved like that
A promise, you can't take back
If you're gonna love me
I want to be loved like that

Daddy never gave momma a diamond ring
Momma never worried for anything
What he gave her came from the heart
A bond that was never torn apart

I want to be loved like that
I want to be loved like that
A promise, you can't take back
If you're gonna love me
I want to be loved like that

An old man kneeling all alone
Plants his flowers in a garden of stone
For seven years now she's been gone
And his devotion is still going strong
