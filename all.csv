Habit alone, when separate I moan
Feeding on bones or anything grown
I command post and nobody shows
In mornings I rest here
In evenings I work here
My debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left
All I adore...

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

I work alone saving my soul
If yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse
Send me a sign, for my body's aligned
I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face
My pores are wide open
And bleed for your potion

I was messed up, dirty as I could be
I was on my way to hell;
But I heard the preacher
Preaching the Word of God
Confess your sins and repent

[Chorus:]
I came to Jesus as I was
Weary, worn, and sad
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made, made me glad

[Verse 2:]
I asked the Lord
""how could He love me
I have sinned against Your will""
But He said, ""repent and I will forgive you
The question's who will you serve?""

You might be dirty, messed up inside
You may even have lost your will to live;
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel

[Verse 1]
I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fuckin' lazy

[Chorus]
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

[Verse 2]
Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise

And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes

Which is the way he wants it

And I don't like it any more than you men

Look at the fear we're feeding

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

Who said, ""Peace could last forever""?

That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

It's your decision, it's a chance that you take
It's on your head, it's a habit that's hard to break

Do you need a friend?
Would you tell no lies?
Would you take me in?
Are you lonely in the dark?
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

You never listen to the voices inside
They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide
You're never sure if the illusion is real
You pinch yourself but the memories are all you feel

Can you break away
From your alibis?
Can you make a play?
Oh, will you meet me in the dark?
In the dark

You make the rounds, oh, you try to be so sincere
You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams
You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene

Can you face the fire
When you see me there?
Can you feel the fire?
Will you love me in the dark?

We smiled without any style
We kiss altogether wrong
No intention
We lied about each other's drinks
We lived without each other thinking
What anyone would do
Without me and you

Only the lonely can play

Hold on to nothin' we know

So long ago, well I don't remember
All I know is that it makes me feel good now

And with a slap of a hand, he had landed as an only son

His mother and father said: ""What a lovely boy?

We'll dress him up warmly and we'll send him to school

Such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night, every evening that I die

[Verse 1]
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

Send a jacker into a coma (Woo!)

Dice symbolise my life, roll 'em on the floor
From your grubby hands as you ham and grandstand
You live a shitty life, we live the bon bon vie
You hide it in the book while we watch the TV
Think you got us fooled? Who? Never again
First time, shame on me, second time, your time will end

Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 2]
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 3]
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head

Too little righteous indignation

The tears I cry could mean anything

Just cause you're kin I let it slide
Insults and judgments I've been blind
And it hard for you to deal out digs
With a calloused heart your words are quick

I'm sick and tired of throwing stones
Cause all that leaves is broken bones
And I won't shed no blood for you
Aww the cuts too deep the bruise too blue

I've wasted time and been hand fed
You can't take back the things you said
Too much time has gone and passed
Shattered lives and broken glass

The pain is felt behind my eyes
But you won't see me through my disguise
Can't change fate cause this is done
Aww too late to start the race is run

Now's the time to face the facts
This train done slid right off the tracks
Regret is sad revenge is sweet

The future's mine indeed it's grand
You ain't a part of my plan

[Verse 1: Myka 9]
Every man for himself, can be difficult, mythical
Typical, critical, pitiful, beautiful, hypocritical, hypothetical
Alpha numerical the Darwinian way, obstacle course fittest survival
Unforgettable, unforgivable
Diabolical lies within the Bible, Unified Field Theory of Love
Ignoramus enlightened to his path and purpose
Creator, preserver, destroyer, curb server
Quantum mechanics converted from bow ties to Mormon
Also a paraplegic, whirling dervish
Pledge of Allegiance backwards
Rocket science nano technology
Awkward moments caught between a rock and a hard place
You're in a sticky situation, zero visibility
Late night radar emergencies passenger pilot
Typhoon, hurricane, broken components
Airstrips, stormy rain, military ship
Landing a plane to Malaysia, amnesia
Indonesia with a squeegee
You were trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents for a ticket to Fiji
With Saturday Night Fever without the Bee Gee's
All the doohickeys and thingamabob's of highly sensitive circuitry
Micro-engineering a blind man behind the wheel steering
Energy equaling matter or mass times the speed of light squared
Foreplay with the Catholic nun, makin' a hoe into a housewife
Making a crack head drop the pipe
Looking at Luke's peep show fully dressed
With a number of angels dancing on a nuclear warhead
Everyone on Earth chanting 'Om...'
Taking bong hits, holding hands, alone
At the same time finding a truly righteous queen in a strip club
Playing patty cakes with heartless thugs
Getting the Fellowship to rehearse for a show
We do reverse to a flow and do a motherfucking overdub

Predicting well before Nostradamus discovered before taking Most of us with us
Forever throwing the Earth off of its axis
The autistic, artistic, art without the practice
The parachute-less, brainless, aimless
Jump out the 25th floor
Onto a mattress, onto Atlantis
Will take the Milky Way, in a filthy way
And try to dig a whole to China with a spoon
Handcuffed to a thousand pounds of C4, while
Dip to the bottom of the sea floor
Then swim back up to the sea shore
Then, I'm a sharpshooting contest
I'll shoot a mango off your head from a mile away
I shot, ran a marathon barefoot and broken glass without a cut
Take my place in the stars, see my face on Mars
Hijack NASA for the shuttle with a .38 inch snubnose
And race the cars, take the negative devil gene out of man
And erase the wars with a straight jacket and a crooked face
And a broken stick shifter, a ceremony for audio-body of
Miracle, spiritual, uplifter
A Siamese twin Libra, connected amoeba
Beautiful, wonderful world without miss moon Makeba
That's impossible like Ethan Hunt
Breathing a blunt, well believe what you want
A serial killer, Gandhi
Loveable Hitler, A fiddler on a burning roof
Learning the truth about the one arm, one leg, one peg, one hook
Rock climber to the top, shock rhymer
Grandfather counter clockwise timer
Old timer, rap, rhyme designer
Purely, indubitably, excellent, brilliantly
Intertwind'er, kinda, off-beat, off-center, odd
Simple yet confusing, God

Or the game, lock it up like a lolo
Rock the cradle like a yo-yo

Another word for alright, so-so
Another word for chocolate, cocoa
Stunt double Wesley Snipes
It's faster than your 4-4
Now that's velvet

Earthquake eerie spots where wackness

Stop, Sergio Tacchini, my cherie amour
Theodore
And Fila, Reebok, silly coq sportif
Where's the beef?
Malt and barley, cereal brands choice
Hot socks with flip-flops
Freshly fried pork chops
Eat moon soup on a moon rock
Collard greens boiled with the ham hocks
Sleep in a ham-mock and I flow from the shamrock
And kill ya kill ya with a four lock Glock 9
Supply mine, spreads the landmines

Fuck Saddam Hussein, there is no God,"" in Arabic
Truthfully, you got a better chance hitting the lottery 15 times in a row
Now you tell me the odd’s on that
You’d rather get head from a wild bobcat
You’d rather slap the chief of police knowing you got 2 strikes
You’d rather run up to the White House with a Bullseye T-Shirt on blasting a starter pistol, yellin' revolution!! revolution!!
You’d rather sky dive butt naked into a field of meat hooks
And bathe in a flammable solution, solution
Holding a Philly overdosing on Heron
You’d rather try to dope fiend Farrakhan
You’d rather walk through a lions den
Wearin' pork chop earrings and cheap top sirloin body oil cologne
You’d rather be fully awake while getting operated on
You got a better chance of going back to the 1920s
As a black transvestite running for president and winning
You’d rather go head up with a swinging wrecking ball

Comes creeping on, so haunting every time

And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?

I'm running and hiding
In my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind
And my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair

The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to Glory

There are whispers between the screams
That this deed can be done
Even sinners must dream
And I can be the one to make the Devil cry

I can win this game
If all things come together
I know this sounds quite strange
I won't be smart, just clever

It's the law on the other side
Just the kill lets you run
And how many have tried?
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry

At last my time has come
I must not give him pleasure
I can be the one
One chance or burn forever

So I told him about my pain
And the life I've been through
He just smiled and the laughter came
Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil cried

Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating
We were the first band to vomit in the bar
And find the distance to the stage too far
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

[Chorus]
Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive

[Verse 2]
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Landslide, rocks are falling
Falling down around our very heads
We tried but you were yawning
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead

Standing with my enemy
Hung on my horns
With haste and reverie
Killing with charm

[Chorus]
Only happy when you hurt
Only deadly in a swarm
Only healthy in the dirt
Only empty in your arm

[Verse 2]
I play, I'm sick and tame
Drawing the hordes
I wait and show the lame
The meaning of harm
The skull beneath my feet
Like feathers in sand
I graze among the graves
A feeling of peace

Only bending when you break
Only feeding when you're cold
Only healing when you ache
Only feeling when you don't

Love was just something you found to add to your collection
It used to seem we were number one, but now it sounds so far away
I had a dream we were running from some blazing arrows yesterday

You said fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire

Now the city blocks out the sun that you know is rising
You can show me the work that you've done, your fears have been disguising
Is it just me or is everyone, hiding out between the lights
Where will we be when we've come undone? Just a simple meeting of the minds

Singing we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Your desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire

Underneath your stars
There's a million lies burning brightly just like fireflies

It's cold and heaven surround you from every direction

I don't know how you can stand next to me
You you talk like a noose
And only confuse my perplexity
Now that I'm so sad and not quite right
I could dance all night
I could dance all night

Shake your rattle-snake skin
And become a part of society
Wait on down the highway
To see how far I'll come a-run a-run
Run running
All that we had salvaged from the fire
Was a waste of time
(But) what a waste of time

Should I trust all the rust that's on TV
I guess with some distaste I disagree
With quite a fashionable dispassion for
The dispossessed under-stressed
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
And I don't care if you don't like it
Or just don't see

Now that we fattened the cow
And set out to plow unknown enemies
""Wow!"" shouts the startled crowd
""How now did you see what I did see?""
The ravaged cabbage drifts on dark red skies
And it looks so nice
Gee it looks so nice

So would you play a game of Russian Roulette
To save your life, are you in, are you in?
Or will you flee to safety, and wonder what could have been?

Vision of the sibyl has foretold
Armies gather on the battle plain
All will fall and Earth will die in flame

Here on the battle plain
We will die in flame

In falcon's feathers soaring overhead
Choosing warriors among the dead
Twilight written in the runes of crones
Freya weeps upon her golden throne

Upon her golden throne
We wait for her alone
Call us unto your hall
Take us into your thrall
The battle rages, but they fight in vain

I'm lying in my bed
Hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
And you said, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look

If you fall, I will catch you

He notified me I was late with the rent

He's a large and ugly giant monster, headless on my back
This urgent haste in my head
Materialized in this dark whole world
No one can help me there
I know this pain has gone too far
The fear is now so loud
Kill a child I'm trying to protect myself
Against your old controlled hate
Pollution of mind filled all the space and destroyed my light
At least mine were never allowed

[Chorus]
The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light

[Verse 2]
I wanted to hate, I wanted to die
I wanted to see you sacrifice
I had to deal with the fear you gave me
But you fucker never tried to help me
I was jealous and I was scared
Nobody ever replaced my pain
To say I'm not evil, to tell I'm not bad
Too late, I'm lost in human nature

Unexpected yet expected, emerged from the dark I come to life
Take everything if you give my horse it's head
You know me, you fear me
Always me knocking at your door, always around
Insulted, disrespected, return to the dark into this life
You know me, you fear me x4

We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned

We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned

But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire

We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

Who are unable to resist

And for that forsake it all

To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks
And say how you been, I've been wondering if
Maybe you've been thinkin about me
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Everyone's known someone that they
Just can't help but want
Even though we just can't make it work out
The want to, lingers on
So once again, we wind up in each other's arms
Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad
I guess that's what it is all lonely

So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling, and I'm begging
To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in

But if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout

And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet

The atomic blast, caused total destruction
Thousands where killed, cities where laid to waste
Merciless genocide, wiped out civilization
The land was reigned, by famine, war and plague

And I reach beside me hoping you will be there
But instead I find someone
Who believed in me when I said I'd always care

There might have been things I missed
But don't be unkind
It don't mean I'm blind

Perhaps there's a thing or two
I think of, lying in bed
I shouldn't have said
But there it is

You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here

And not been so cruel
Not been such a fool

Whatever was done is done

To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death
[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Christian, if you see your papa, tell him I love him
He taught me to love in the wild and fight in the gym

And you won't get hurt if you just keep your hands up
And stand tall like sycamores

Sycamore got to grow down to grow up
Young roots toil the soil like baby's first cup

And say too green for the fire
When all you want to do is be a part of the fire
All you want to do is be the fire part of fire

In God I distrust
In time, His monuments will fall

neg,"1 ContributorSpeak No Evil LyricsDon't go around spreading rumours
Even if what you say is true
Before you go and tell your tales
You better think things true

So speak no evil, Evil won't happen to you

I've been mad enough to kill someone
But I couldn't face the task
So I tried to shout them down
With this big mouth of mine

So speak no evil, evil will get you in time

I've been about ..... that that shouldn't mess with you
Every time that I lied, you know I mean to tell the truth
No matter where I go , no matter what I do or say
Somebody gonna telling me, when they oughtta back away

Words thrown out in anger, always come back to haunt you
Once they go they told me, talk so hard to undo
So speak no evil, evil will come back to you
Better speak no evil, evil will come back to youYou might also likeEmbed"

I got wasted on the moonshine

Too far gone

Outside they was beatin on the door
Somebody goin down tonight

Just a unhappy with a man

[Verse 1: AKA]
Ooh ah, fresh out the bed
New Jordan 3s, got a spring in my step
Do my devotion and drop in a X
Hit thе Off-ramp and go right to the bag
This shit is pendulum motion, it swings
I just sit back and let God do his thing
Tint in my windows so you can't see in
I closе the circle, we out for revenge
I am a fan of ‘Piano but I cannot bend over backwards to fit in with trends
Tell me what happened with Mega?
Go platinum, I’d rather sell nothing, than lie to my fans
This ain’t a costume, I zip up and wear
Jesus is closer and the devil is near
Just got a text that say 150k, 25th of December, I told them ""No way"", uh
Family first is the wave
MTV List only sharpened the blade
Not even once did they put me first place
Tragedy happened, has tracks under caption
Gave me the idea to put noose on my neck
Thought of my daughter, I had to persist
Lawyers on lawyers, they cost me a fortune
They loya’ed, they loya'ed, put price on my head (Huh)
And I mean full disrespect
DJ's, y’all just stand behind the decks (Huh)
Sacrificed, blood, sweat and tears (Huh)
Too many treacherous spins (Mhm)

Besides give me more stress than you ever imagined?
Everything I thought was bigger than me was revealed to be cap

Came face-to-face with the devil and national treasure protea

All that I ever wanted was money for retros
Now everytime that I spit it's a swish

There was no one around
But you were there for me
When the rain came down
Into every sunny day
A little rain must fall
And without the rain upon us
Would we ever grow
Like so many others I was too afraid of change
'Till I put my trust in you
You took away my pain

I allowed my fears to take hold of me
Had nowhere to run 'cause
I was too deep
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me

Waited for a better day that seems so far away
Even though my faith was shaky, you showed me the way
I was searching for a way that I could make it through
Figured out what I did wrong
I didn't trust in you

'Cause through any weather, there's someone I can call
Storm clouds may rise

Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost

He rides a feed lot and clerks in a market
On weekends selling tobacco and beer
His dreams of tomorrow surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball Ol' Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis L'Amour has told us his tale
And Willie and Waylon and me sing about him
And wish to God we could have ridden his trail

The Old Chisholm Trail is covered in concrete now
And they truck 'em to market in fifty foot rigs
They blow by his market never slowing to reason
Like living and dying was all he did
This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz

Distant stars
Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head
They connect
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
Then dive as deep as they can

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is in outer heart
And the space has been broken

Forever we'll go out into the night with survival in all our eyes
With knives in hand we stab at the sands of time
To turn back and unwind
Under the death of an age when we were becoming stronger than...
With terror in our eyes, we wait on these skies to bring a new chapter

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

Like lions we tow the line, blood sewn pact with truth inside
With knives in hand we stab at the sands of time
To turn back and unwind
Under the death of age, we were becoming stronger than...
With terror in our eyes, we wait on these skies to bring a new chapter

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

That you've never written
I can't begin to compromise
On a problem that you have invented

Dead stares cut a paper heart
And beats ink in these pages
Letters written in regret
To many lifeless faces
This is the end of me
I am running on empty

Hours spent pouring over these words
With nothing gained
All that was lost with nothing learned
I'm just feeling drained

This is taking so much out of me
I am doubting my place as of late

I wish I could make this paper heart come alive
All my time spent on writing this living lie

With blood on our knives

Vapor to float on
Still we roll on through the night

Taken down by the hounds, one by one

Expected to find my Toby waiting
Called her on her private phone
She didn't answer
Something was wrong

I ran all the way to her house
Rang her bell
Her mother answered and told me
To come and sit a spell

I sat down to try to be prepared
For what she'd say
And what she said
Brought tears to my eyes
I couldn't push away

Toby left on a cloudy, rainy day
She went to sing with the angels
Toby's gone away

Oh, oh, Toby went away

All the children grown
And, like starlings, flown away
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Ev'ry single endless day

When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?

Still the old heart's young enough to say

And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart

Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes

Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race

Just a fleeting illusion to be pursued

Get up, get out, get out of the door
You're playin cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a livin, we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But u can always tell your better half

Give me a good reason why I shouldn't start a revolution
What's in the constitution? Is this illusion that we buy?
You cut the wings and then you say fly
You say the hero is the one that died
But the true hero is the one who doesn't live a lie and understands
That there's an end out of the cycle
Who's the master? Who's the disciple?
You can do what you can, but will you do it again?
So what's the plan?

She's always complaining 'bout me never being at home
But when I'm there, I'm broke
She's telling me 'bout the things that her girlfriend's got
What she ain't got
And she want me to go out and get' em for her, but
But girl, I can't be in two places at one time

If you think you're lonely now, huh
Wait until tonight, girl
I'll be long gone (If you think you're lonely now)
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right (Wait until tonight, girl)

If you didn't care what happened to me
And I didn't care for you
We would zigzag our way through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing

You know that I care what happens to you
And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone

When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart
When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away, you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

[Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

[Verse 2]
When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart
Tell her you're glad
It's over, in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back?
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a playboy, you said no (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This little girl mind, you will blow (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But then it blew you out the box (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I put my stuff on key and lock (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
It makes me feel kind of sick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
To know love put you in a trick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I knew our love would have to end (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
The day I made it with your friend (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Giving your love to one unreal (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Like a big fool, I know you feel (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But in this lovie-dovie game (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
With all its joy, there must be pain (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But now the time has surely come (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This game don't seem like so much fun (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're crying big crocodile tears (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Don't match the ones I've cried for years (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I was home waiting for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You were out somewhere doing the do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You know I'd really like to stay (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But like you did, I've got to play (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're dumb to think I'd let you be (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Scott-free without some pain from me (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I heard your song and took a chance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But to your music, I can't dance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Go tell your story, sob-sad (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)

Closing in with vengeance soaring high

A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder, blasting bolts of steel

In need of company
And like some angel's haloed brow
You reek of purity
I see your armour-plated breast
Has long since lost its sheen
And in your death mask face
There are no signs which can be seen

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador a vulture sits
Upon your silver shield
And in your rusty scabbard now
The sand has taken seed
And though your jewel-encrusted blade
Has not been plundered still
The sea has washed across your face
And taken of its fill

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador there is no time
I must pay my respect
And though I came to jeer at you
I leave now with regret
And as the gloom begins to fall
I see there is no, only all
And though you came with sword held high
You did not conquer, only die

In dreams of black, beyond the bounds of a withered witch's spell
Where the doors surely are locked when the sun threatens to wane
Where shamblers dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day
Liars line the roads at dawn
Watchful eyes are upon you held
Sacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell
Blood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh
Where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead
Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man
Into the tower, never go; the horrors multiply
The gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed
The rivers flow with poison
The sands swallow you whole
The ghouls that roam this darkened wood are thirsting for your throat

Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds

Doing nothing
Still doing nothing
Drinking, smoking
Nothing's happening
No one seems to care
In their wooden chair
Doing nothing

I go walking through the park
Underneath a moldy sky
Thinking ""yes I think this place
Would be such a lonely place to die
Such a lonely place to die

Nothing we're doing nothing
Literally frozen stiff from nothing happening
Something has to change
Cause it's no longer feeling strange
To do nothing Ad nauseam nothing
And feeling acutely every millisecond pass
We can ignore that this is sad
Because we know that it all adds up to nothing

Underneath the moldy sky
Thinking about all the different ways that would make lonely ways to die

I am your sinking stone
I'd rather be alone than drag you down and pick you up
Haven't you been through enough?

I am the cruel one
Don't know how I've become
A movie where the acting shows somebody you used to know
You used to know

[Chorus]
Oh no
I don't want to wake up feeling like I'm no one
I don't want to wake up wondering how did I become the Cruel one

[Verse 2]
It's quicker than you think
Sadness spreads out like ink on the road and on the sea
On the roof and balcony

I was using loneliness and now it's using me
There's nothing left to give to you
One thing left to say to you

Oh no

I don't want to wake up wondering how did I become the Cruel one

A hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me, infectious sense
Of hopelessness and prayers for rain

I suffocate, I breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

You fracture me, your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me, entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain

And nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

Today I woke up uncertain,
and you know that gives me the fits,
so I left this land of fungible convictions
because it seemed like the pits.
When I say, ""conviction"", I mean it's something to abjure
and when I say ""uncertain"", I mean to doubt I'll not turn out a caricature.
So I set off in search of my forebearers,
coz my forbearance was in need,
but the only job I could get in dear old Blighty
was working on the railway between Selby and Leeds.
So I took a ferry to Belfast, where I had cause to think:
They wanted none of my arm-chair convictions
but nobody seemed to mind when I was putting on the drinks!

And you didn't think they could hate you, now did you?
You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?
You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?
Ah, but they hate you, and they hate you 'coz you're guilty! so...

I stayed out all night in Ibiza,
by way of San Sebastian,
where they said;
'Yankee, you better watch what you're saying, unless you're sayin'
it in Basque or in Catalan!""
So all the way east to Novi Sad,
where narry a bridge was to be seen,
but Mother Russia, she laid her pontoons on down,
so I crossed over, if you know what I mean...
Then on the road to Damascus,
yes, the scales, they fell from my eyes,
and the simplest lesson I learned at the Mount of Olives: everybody lies.
And the french foreign legion
you know they did their best -
but I never believed in T.E. Lawrence,
so how the hell could i believe in Beau Geste?

You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?
You didnt think they could hate you, now did you?
You didnt think they could hate you, now did you?
Ah, but they hate you, and they hate you 'coz you're guilty! So...

I spent a night in Kigali, in a five diamond hotel,
where maybe someday, they'll do the Watusi down in Hutu hell.
I fell in with a merchant marine who promised to take me home,
but when I woke up beaten and bloodied,
I couldn't tell if it was Jersey or Sierra Leone!

And you didn't think they could hate you, now did you?
You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?
You didn't think they could have you, now did you?
Ah, but they hate you, and they hate you coz you're guilty...

And the knocking in my head, just like the knocking at my door.
Maybe it was me or maybe it was my brother,
but either me or me and him went down to the bar,
where I got seven powers in me for to give me the cure,
but when seven powers failed to spin me,
I had to get me seven more.
And when I say, ""me"" I mean my brain.
And when I say ""give me the cure"" I mean to kill the pain.
And when I say ""kill the pain"" I meant to get the devil out.
And when I say ""devil"" I mean the manifestation of doubt!

And you didnt think they could hate you, now did you?

You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?

Here's a new dance craze that's sweepin' the nation
It's called the Toxic Waltz and it's causin' devastation
You're jumpin' up and down like a psycho circus clown
Slammin' with waltzers all the way around
You get caught up in the whip, you're thrown into a flip
Then you aim for someone's head to stain the floor red
Give someone a kick to prove you're truly sick
Bounce back from some blows and blood runs out your nose

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!
And this exercise helps you brutalise
With us! Exodus!

Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
You might also likeUsed to do the monkey, but now it's not cool
The twist and mashed potato are no exception to the rule
So don't be a dunce and dance like a runt
Just throw your elbows with good friendly, violent fun
Don't start to cry if you get a black eye
Just dive back in and give another try
But too much action may leave you in traction
So you better get insurance no matter your endurance

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!
And this exercise helps you brutalise
With us! Exodus!

Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
[Instrumental Break]

Get up on your feet
Don't look so obsolete
And thrash like an athlete!
Don't sit there on your ass
Don't look like you got too much class
You'll be harassed!
You know we guarantee
This is the key
So rage or get the third degree!
You begin frontal assaults
And start your somersaults
And do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!1Embed"

Put down your gloves

This is no showdown
So throw down your guns

Or from a park bench
You could be a politician
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave

Fight like a brave
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
If you're sick-a-sick n tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying

I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
'Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

I'd rather shoot up a syringe filled with fire, fire, fire

One last tender lie and

What is your desire?
How can I help a poor soul?
Swallow the solution I offer you
Exhale and you lose all your fear

Just give it a try

So I do what you ask me to do

It's never too late for a twist of fate
Believe and elate your mind
And try to segregate the feelings you hate

Don't you feel better now?
Rely onto me

Fear me and take me
Die a thousand times

Cause I can't stand the uncertainty
Why can't I just see another side of myself

A crime is just a crime if you get sentenced for it

Finally death is what I sell
Hate is my business and I create your hell

Stones to pebbles, see them roll away
My wandering troubles need not break my back
Mmm, sorrow is the price I pay

I sing my sorrows to the morning; I speak them to the night
You best believe I'll keep singing until I make my wrongs so right
Devil said, a pity for your troubles to take your tired old soul
So you know you got to go

Hurry, to catch the morning
You got to hurry on now
In the night
I would heed my sorrow
And it knows, won't be long now
Hurry

Now with blind hands, I crawl this lonely place
As my dry tears fall and roll away
I can't see troubles as they dance behind my back
Ooo, sorrow is my soul to slay

He stole my sorrows from the morning; he ripped them from the night
And you best believe I'll keep singing to make my wrongs so right
Devil took a pity of my troubles; he holds my tired old soul

Driftin' down to Santa Fe to ride a bull in a rodeo
He's hooked on a feelin'
Addicted to a natural high
Don't know why it's appealin'
All he knows is he's got to ride

Ruled by passion and pride
To pain and fear he's no stranger
But his lust needs to satisfied
Hooked on an eight second ride

Gettin' up down in back of the chutes
Makes that rosin burn
He's got his spurs on the heels of his boots
He's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate he settles down inside
The tension's risin'
But he can't wait until they turn that bull outside

It first seems so insane like a vagrant in the rain

All the eyes of little girls will be flames that dance and swirl
And they'll melt you to your bones, char your eyes turn you to stone
And when the future finds you there and they stack you in the air

No love to spend on you

And your face at night
Dances tick-tock on my brain, digs it's digits in my face

When I hold the fury of the world

And they'll melt you to your bones, char your eyes turn you to stone
And when the future finds you there and they stack you in the air
I'll be there to burn down that skyscraper too

Standing here in disarray
A calm serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide
Gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun

Surrounded by everything I want
But nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdities
Losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need
To find that road
Right around that curve a lesson learned
Now that I have the eyes to see

[Chorus]
A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

[Verse 2]
With poison toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treasure is
'Cause they only blocked my view
I'm spiraling down but so oblivious
Got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone?

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war
We, the people speak, speak
We want to be free of this sick bureaucracy
No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life

It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak

Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak

Your lies are your destruction, your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal, you are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow, your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage, it rots and it reeks
Of death in the wind, the foul stench of men
Basking in their cruelty, rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride, you risk all of humanity

You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know, people they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace

But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach
Deep, deep down in our beings
Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things

As our grandmothers say
Will soon be no more, will soon be no more
Because nobody, no one ever wins a warEmbed"

We came from your nightmares
And we're calling for your souls
Your endless death begins today
The Bloody Pit has final say
The Bloody Pit, the bloody war
The only bloody way

The Bloody Pit of Horror
It feed on endless souls
The carnage must be unimpeded
Blood and souls are what is needed
The killing goes on day and night
We'll never fill this hole

The Bloody Pit, it doesn't care
About the why, the when, the where
As guts are ripped and blood is spilled
It only knows it must be filled
And that's the way its always been
Never change, never win

[Pre-Chorus]

Just why we're here
It's for something more important
Thank for drinking all your beer

And claim your souls
And drape your stinking entrails round

'Cause my specs give me perfect sight
And in a second I can see it all
Everything becomes delightful
I'm not afraid of the dark or noise
I'm not daunted by the bark of boys
I'm with the birds flying in blue skies
Feathery free and I'm feeling fine
This city is a golden gate
The kind of gold that I love to hate
How good it gets in the hype and stress
Even though it's all a well-lit mess
Bury, bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Hurry, bury me up to my knees
I'll swing my branches better in the breeze

Mental mammoth, I know I have a very bad habit
Of filling up my cup halfway elephantasizing my eyes
Vision still untrained in seeing what I have gained
A simple remedy of walking into trees
Mistaking birds as bees
Mistaking things I see

Bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Hurry bury me over my head
Level with the living, level with the dead
Bury, bury better plant your feet down

Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die?

[Verse 2]
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind

As you savour the flavour of murder

[Verso 1]
El amor es una gota de agua en un cristal
Es un paseo largo sin hablar
Es una fruta para dos
El amor es un espacio en donde no hay lugar
Para otra cosa que no sea amar
Es algo entre tú y yo

[Coro]
El amor es llorar cuando nos dice adiós
El amor es soñar oyendo una canción
El amor es besar poniendo el corazón
Es perdonarme tú y comprenderte yo
El amor es parar el tiempo en un reloj
Es buscar un lugar donde escuchar tu voz
El amor es crear un mundo entre los dos
Es perdonarme tú y comprenderte yo

And she got the right to
Low button down, or WSL shades, the ice is bright too
And I'm around Gomes, might as well let me get her
I promise to send her back tomorrow, 'round noon
Sore loser, but a good winner
Besides that she could use a little hood in her
A 40 from auto bond and a hood inner
You can bend her in the Range, back seat, at the center
Get violent, if money wanna try me
There's somethin' on the top of my flicky that spits silent
I don't feel haters and if you feeling some kinda way
E-mail him and tell him your still Jada's

Every time I turn around, the boys fightin' over me
Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death, and I'm so, so, so sexy
All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me

If you wanna go abroad, you're gonna need a black dodd
And welcome to Paris

Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer, then move on ahead

Forced into a life of slavery
Forced to fight your brothers for rulers so cruel

Ferocious battle, you must fight to survive
Each weapon an extension of your strength
All victories add greatness to your name
Fight to the death, there will be no surrender
Your cunning must be afforded
There will be no remorse for those who gamble with your fate
Freedom, through killing strangers will it come
You fight to live, freedom gained with every shiv
You need to prove, prove your worth
To ascend to the trial of champions
Every fight a battle to the death
Your fate lies in the hands of fools
A meager wager more precious than your life
When the thumb comes down
You know just what to do

Once I crossed the line I think I must have zigged when I should have zagged

Kickin' the Bobby bullshit, too smart for Willie Bobo
Not stressin' five-o, hot hand in cee-lo
Live in the land of crooks yes Brooklyn's the borough

Where the manic depressive psycho murderers stalk
Walk like a ninja on the asphalt
Here talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk
And there's more hardtimes than on Good Times
And most niggas dedicate their life to crime
So I'm steady schemin', won't work for a dime
Used to get tax free loot all the time
Type slick can't fess on 'Ru because

Dirty because of the skin I'm in, the fact I have -

Conditioned workhorses park at a stoplight
Seasoned vets with their feet in nets
A stone's throw away from a rock fight

Nothing to live for
What started with a simple match
Turned into something more
The pain I felt inside my head
Came on my day of birth
Now the time has come for me
To burn the planet Earth

I can feel the fire burn inside of me
The power's at my fingers, waiting you shall see

Burn, ignite the population
Burn, causing mass cremation
Burn, feel no shame or pity
Burn, apocalyptic city

Years have passed as I stood still
To plan the final blow
I'll make the town go up in flames
A hellish death they'll know
As I pour on the gasoline
I listen deep inside
I hear the cries of all my victims
Nowhere to run or hide

But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'

Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?

On the peat of Mt. Cithren

To command all earth and men

And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats itself
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me

A dark cloud covered my heart
Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

No matter how strong a man is
Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart

The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Because I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart againEmbed"

Can't buy me love, love

[Verse 1]
I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me, too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got, I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!

Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things

And wake up when the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Never as good
No, baby

[Verse 1]
Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right
Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you
So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands sayin', ""How do you do""
They're really sayin', ""I love you""

I hear babies cry I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know

I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within

I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything, but you don't give up

Another summer day has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm
May be surrounded by a million people, I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine, baby, how are you?
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another aeroplane, another sunny place
I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home
Mmm, I got to go home

[Chorus]
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day has come and gone away
In either Paris or Rome, and I wanna go home
Let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people, I
I still feel alone

Flashbacks of the times we've had
Some made us laugh, and some made us sad
We used to break up to make up
All the fun that came from those love games
Oh, when I think I need someone new
Naw, it just won't do
Because I think about you, baby

I want your same ol' love, baby, uh-huh
All I wanna do, is keep on loving you
I want your same ol' love

There's a reason that I feel this way
All the things you do
Well, it might be the things that you say
Your love never changes
It's like a picture in a frame, and it remains the same
Your undying love for me, oh, it keeps me strong
Keeps me holding on

We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm

I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

I love sleeping in on Saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And good barbecue
Yea I'm a fan of Faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouthed bass have got me hooked on Sunday afternoons

Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud Honky Tonk that rocks on Friday nights
And hell yes I love my truck but I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most

Damn I love my Nascar race

What God has willed what God has planned
I only know at His right hand
Stands One who is my Savior

There's thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fists

When He kicked 'em out of Eden
It wasn't for no reason
That He shed His blood
His return is very close

You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right, alright

When they wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

With one light on in one room
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there

[Pre-Chorus]
If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own

[Chorus 1]
Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go

The unread book and painful look
The TV's on, the sound is down
One long pause, then you begin
Oh, look what the cat's brought in

To take a chance on life again

There's a big brown cloud in the city
And the countryside's a sin
And the price of life is too high to give up
Got to come down again
When the world wide war is over and done
And the dream of peace comes true
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
When they find out how to burn water
And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up
And the sun come shining through

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

[Chorus]
Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon
Underneath that sky of blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
There's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away from me

And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echoes say we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now

She arrives in all her splendor
Each night at nine o'clock
Her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar's home again

[Chorus]
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules a smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her trying to win her favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home

[Verse 2]
Now her royal dress is satin
It's shabby and it's torn
The royal jewels are rhinestones
The shoes are scuffed and worn
Of the many roads she's been down
And the places that she's seen
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen

[Chorus]
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules a smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her trying to win her favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home

Now the queen of the Silver Dollar
Is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But there's a man who found her
And he brought her to this world
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl

[Chorus]
Yes I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule a smokey kingdom
My scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around my trying to win my favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home

They wonder how does a man get to be this way

Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song
That i always sing

So, she said, ""What's the problem, baby?""
What's the problem? I don't know
Well, maybe I'm in love (Love)
Think about it
Every time I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (Love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothin' 'bout love, uh

Come on, come on
Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
The world will follow after
Come on, come on

Runnin' down into the spring that's comin'
All this love meltin' under blue skies
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love
Well, baby, I surrender
To this strawberry ice cream

There was noise in the hall; snow was flowing in the air
And I could see just then the flashing spark
Of the match to my first smoke

Some houses are built to last
It's the couple inside that change too fast
I can see their faces looking through the glass
They're not where they belong

I want to stay with you, baby
Won't you let me stay?
You're a Beautiful Girl
I'm right where I belong, baby
I'm here with you
You're a Beautiful Girl

I see your feet at the edge of the bed
While an old Love song is creeping into your head
And as your eyes just closed I could only guess
If you were dreaming of me again

Stained glass casts a flickering light
With the curtains closed I can't tell if it's night
But I know for sure that this sure feels right
With you here between my arms

If you disrespect anybody
That you run in to
How in the world do you think
Anybody's supposed to respect you?
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man
With the Bible in his hand
Just get out the way
And let the gentleman do his thing

You're the kind of gentleman
That want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na, na, na, na
Respect yourself, respect yourself

Keep talkin' 'bout the president
Won't stop air pollution
Put your hand on your mouth
When you cough, that'll help the solution

Oh, you cuss around women folk
And you don't even know their names
And you're dumb enough to think
That'll make you a big ol' man

We been building on the slow but to see it come together
It's like a dream's achievable

We had bumps along the way, quite a few surprises
But we held fast, dealt with all the compromises
Put our pride aside how we sacrifice so long
For something we could call our own

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

I used to think of all the things we've overcome
As just our history
But now I know that all the things we built together
Will be our legacy

The world will know that we were here
Our intent to stay sincere, our purpose and hearts were clear
Our babies will have babies of their own

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky

And you can get it if you try

And I live to the south of town
I work my window, watching the women
Go round and round

Some people come for fantasy
When two in the morning comes around
My baby comes around for me

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one

One day, we'll walk in the sun

Watching the men always looking down
Sometimes I feel like an animal
In the zoo, staring out

No one looks me in the eye
They save it for the girls inside

I know she saves it all for me

If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

[Verse 2]
In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered 'round a checker board
Old men tellin' lies and crownin' kings
Kids drivin' 'round the old town square
Cops roll down in the cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen

(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

When we go for a little walk
Out on the land
When we're just walking and holding hands

You can take it as a sign of love
When the winds of fate
Keep blowing and we both understand

It's a sign of love

When we both have silver hair
And a little less time
But there still are roses on the vine

You can take it as a sign of love
When I look at you
When I'm looking at you for a long, long time

You were just a girl
And I was a man

I laid there feeling sorry for myself
In a bed of Kleenex
Stuffing chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend
Cussing my ex

He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinking I can't get over him

[Chorus]
Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love
Strange

[Verse 2]
Got half a mind
To spend my whole pay check
On one of those dresses
The strapless black ones
That are so famous
For teaching lessons

Pick up the rest of my things
He'll tell me I look good
I'll laugh and say, yeah I will in time

I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love

With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love

When the one you love is hangin' off of his side of the bed
Baby, you're just barely hangin' on
Honey I know you'll soon be gone

And I don't need my palm read to know what lies ahead
I can see you in the arms of another girl instead
Baby this ain't the first time you've done it to me
Honey it's gonna be the last time

And I know you think that I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time

I don't care who or what you're doin'
Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'
Baby this time I swear it's the truth
I ain't gonna cry no more for you
Uh-uh

Now I know where I'm goin' baby I know where I'm bound
I've been rearranging chairs on a ship that's goin' down
Baby, just step aside if you would
Honey, it's really over for good

And you might want to talk to me, you might want to call
But you won't hear nothin' out of me at all
Cause Baby, I ain't got nothin' left to say
Honey, I'll just be on my way

Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand
Open up your mind and then open up your heart
And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart

'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

Violence is spread worldwide and there's families on-the street
And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

But I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

Ooooh

I've been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year
She said she's never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear
That one day daddy's gonna find out she's in love
With a nigga from the streets
Oh how he would lose it then but she's still here with me
'Cause she believes that love will see it through
And one day he'll understand
And he'll see me as a person and not just a black man

And holding fast to truth
Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy

But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

But sometimes it’s a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive

Stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one-man submarine?

pos,"1 ContributorSleep Forever LyricsYesterday the sky was cold and grey
Kept me as a prisoner in my home
Ground through my door when I was all alone
Scowled down on me laughed with the Sun
As he hid himself from darkness from everyone

The sky sometimes, so unkind, first he rains and then he shines
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
I will love you 'til the sky above you, shatters over you and me
And lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la

The sky today was brilliant and blue
Brightened up the walkway to my door
Brought you as a sunbeam on my floor
Beamed you down on me from the other side
Brought you up to me across the ocean wide

The sky sometimes so unkind then again he’s my best friend
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
I will love you 'til the sky above you, shatters over you and me
And lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-laYou might also likeEmbed"

I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you found the answer
You told me to take this chance
And learn the ways of love, my baby
And all that it has to offer
In time you will see
That love won't let you down

You said that you loved me
Said hurt only came to pass me
It sounded so convincing
That I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby
There is so much love inside me
And all that I have
I give my all to you
All, all my love, baby

And all this love is waiting for you

Traveling through this world alone
There is no sickness, toil nor danger
In that fair land to which I go

I know my pathway is rough and steep

Where weary eyes no more will weep

She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own, I never had a home
And an eighteen-year-old boy has got to eat

[Verse 2]
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose

This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

[Verse 3]
She was a handsome woman just thirty-five
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do

And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of, I suppose
But she died knowing that I really loved her

In the past there were arguments for and against casual sex. Then it became a question of morality. These days it can be a question of life or death. It's as simple as that. And this song is not about casual sex

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
There's things that you guess
And a'things a'that you know
There's boys you can trust
And a'girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

[Pre - Chorus]
I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies (Yeah)
Don't need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
I've a'waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

[Chorus]
I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your...sex

It's playin' on my mind
It's dancin' on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go
I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say no

[Pre - Chorus]
I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies (Yeah)
Don't need no Bible
Just look in my eyes (Oooh)
I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can't take much more girl
I'm losing control

[Chorus]
I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your…sex (sex! ow!)
[Bridge]
It's natural, it's chemical (let's do it)
It's logical habitual (can we do it?)
It's sensual but most of all
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you
Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when it's one on one
One on one

[Break]
Hoo ah (sex) I'm not your father
Hoo ah (sex) I'm not your brother
Hoo ah (sex) talk to your sister
Hoo ah (sex) I am a lover
Hoo ah (sex) Wooooo-ooooohh!!
Hoo ah (sex)
Hoo ah (sex) Ow!
C-c-c-c-c-c-come on (Hoo ah)

[Outro]
What's your definition of dirty baby?
What do you consider pornography?
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby?
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me?
What's your definition of dirty baby?
What do you call pornography?
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby?
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me?
Ow! Sex with me

Let's make love, put your trust in me (hmm)
Don't you listen to what they told you
Because I love you, let me hold you

Oh, I'm not your brother
I'm not your father
Oh will you ever change your mind?
I'm a gentle lover with a heart of gold
But baby you've been so unkind...oh

pos,"1 ContributorTalamasca LyricsFrom that crazy night
I never forget my love
Before he pile of logs
She stood like unconscious ghost
A last scream from the stake
Her mother was burnt, she heard
The crowd...

I took her far away, over the seas
Far from the fears I thought
But the demon followed
Lover of the witches and their souls

And now I had to see her there
On the place she's always feared
The flames waited for her blood
'Cause of her demon's fault...

""I've never hurt you, I've never been
The witch you want to burn
The witch you kill!
Oh, Lasher come
Show me your love
Give me a vengence,a great last fight
Show me your power
To show them mine
Destroy these liars, my untrue sons
The killer crowd...""
And the storm came, the wind blew blood
Walls fell down on human's flood
Souls got burnt in the flashes of anger
My witch stepped in the tower of the temple
You might also likeThrough her eyes, a world of sorrow
Told me a
Tale of fears and horror
In their hearts, she saw all lies:
Her suffer made the demon awake...

I saw her falling, I saw her blood
Flowing out of her scarlet mouth

To take her body on the fameing logsEmbed"

We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

Lost my pop when I was 14
Shot again at 20 will I shake these old dreams
Lord wake me up to holy water on my face and 3 blood drops dried on the side of my eyes
Why we gotta kill our own kind when we rise
Got me looking down the ladder now when I climb
Pulling up on my nephews
And they don't wanna drive
They wanna learn how to work the tool
And who am I not to do the duty
Just think if pops advice get sent from black ink
And that stinks, but homie that's real
And in the hood even steaks smell bad on the grill
I remember when if you was a hustler you was a winner
Now that's like raking up leaves in the winter
And that ain't even cool to miss a few summers, shit

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if

Do you think I'd come runnin at the drop of a hat?
Oh baby don't you know me any better than that?
You're hot one minute, and gone the next
So tell me what do you expect?

You're standin' there tellin' me you're home for good
Did you think I'd believe it? did you think I would?
You can turn it right around, where you come from
'cause you and me are over and done

Chorus

I won't be home tonight
I'll get along just fine without you
Don't bother callin' me tonight
Oh baby take it somewhere else

Take it somewhere else

Oh you think it's so easy, all you ever gotta do
To make every man roll over for you
You tell 'em something nice, show your baby blues

Broken-hearted people staring at me
All searching 'cause they still believe

So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of
I heard no warning, but a heart can tell
I'd feel the emptiness of love I know so well

pos,"5 ContributorsThe Aeneid (book 4) Lyrics[1] But the queen, long since smitten with a grievous love-pang, feeds the wound with her lifeblood, and is wasted with fire unseen. Oft to her mind rushes back the hero’s valour, oft his glorious stock; his looks and words cling fast to her bosom, and longing withholds calm rest from her limbs.

[6] The morrow’s dawn was lighting the earth with the lamp of Phoebus, and had scattered from the sky the dewy shades, when, much distraught, she thus speaks to her sister, sharer of her heart: “Anna, my sister, what dreams thrill me with fears? Who is this stranger guest who ahs entered our home? How noble his mien! How brave in heart and feats of arms! I believe it well – nor is my confidence vain – that he is sprung from gods. It is fear that proves souls base-born. Alas! by what fates is he vexed! What wars, long endured, did he recount! Were the purpose not planted in my mind, fixed and immovable, to ally myself with none in bond of wedlock, since my first love, turning traitor, cheated me by death; were I not tired of the bridal bed and torch, to this one fault, perhaps, I might have yielded! Anna – for I will own it – since the death of my hapless lord Sychaeus, and the shattering of our home by a brother’s murder, he alone has swayed my will and overthrown my tottering soul. I feel again a spark of that former flame. But rather, I would pray, may earth yawn for me to its depths, or may the Almighty Father hurl me with his bolt to the shades – the pale shades and abysmal night in Erebus – before, Shame, I violate you or break your laws! He who first linked me to himself has taken away my heart; may he keep it with him, and guard it in the grave!” So saying, she filled her breast with upwelling tears.

[31] Anna replies: “O you who are dearer to your sister than the light, are you, lonely and sad, going to pine away all your youth long, and know not sweet children or love’s rewards? Do you think that dust or buried shades give heed to that? Grant that until now no wooers moved your sorrow, not in Libya, not before then in Tyre; that Iarbas was slighted, and other lords whom the African land, rich in triumphs, rears; will you wrestle also with a love that pleases? And does it not come to your mind whose lands you have settled in? On this side Gaetulian cities, a race invincible in war, unbridled Numidians, and the unfriendly Syrtis hem you in; on that side lies a tract barren with drought, and Barcaeans, raging far and wide. Why speak of the wars rising from Tyre, your brother’s threats . . . ? I certainly believe that it was with the gods’ favour and Juno’s aid that the Ilian ships held their course hither with the wind. What a city you will see rise here, my sister, what a realm, by reason of such a marriage! With Teucrian arms beside us, to what heights will Punic glory soar? Only ask favour of the gods and, with sacrifice duly offered, be lavish with your welcome, and weave pleas for delay, while at sea winter rages fiercely and Orion is stormy – while the ships are shattered, and the skies intractable!”

[54] With these words she fanned into flame the queen’s love-enkindled heart, put hope in her wavering mind, and loosed the bonds of shame. First they visit the shrines and sue for peace at every altar; duly they slay chosen sheep to Ceres the law-giver, to Phoebus and father Lyaeus, above all to Juno, guardian of the bonds of marriage. Dido herself, matchless in beauty, with cup in hand, pours libation midway between the horns of a white heifer, or in presence of the gods moves slowly to the rich altars, and day by day renews her gifts, then, gazing into the opened breasts of victims, consults the quivering entrails. Ah, the blind souls of seers! Of what avail are vows or shrines to one wild with love? All the while the flame devours her tender heartstrings, and deep in her breast lives the silent wound. Unhappy Dido burns, and through the city wanders in frenzy – even as a hind, smitten by an arrow, which, all unwary, amid the Cretan woods, a shepherd hunting with darts has pierced from afar, leaving in her the winged steel, unknowing: she in flight ranges the Dictaean woods and glades, but fast to her side clings the deadly shaft. Now through the city’s midst she leads Aeneas with her, and displays her Sidonian wealth and the city built; she begins to speak and stops with the word half-spoken. Now, as day wanes, she seeks that same banquet, again in her madness craves to hear the sorrows of Ilium and again hangs on the speaker’s lips. Then when all have gone their ways, and in turn the dim moon sinks her light, and the setting stars invite sleep, alone she mourns in the empty hall, and falls on the couch he has left. Though absent, each from each, she hears him, she sees him, or, captivated by his look of his father, she holds Ascanius on her lap, in case she may beguile a passion beyond all utterance. No longer rise the towers begun, no longer do the youth exercise in arms, or toil at havens or bulwarks for safety in war; the works are broken off and idle – great menacing walls and cranes that touch the sky.

[90] Soon as the loved wife of Jove saw that Dido was held in a passion so fatal, and that her good name was now no bar to her frenzy, the daughter of Saturn accosts Venus thus: “Splendid indeed is the praise and rich the spoils you win, you and your boy; mighty and glorious is the power divine, if one woman is subdued by the guile of two gods! Nay, it escapes me not how, in fear of our city, you have held in suspicion the homes of high Carthage. But what shall be the end? And what is the point of all this contest now? Why do we not rather strive for an enduring peace and a plighted wedlock? What you sought with all your heart you have; Dido is on fire with love and has drawn the madness through her veins. Let us then rule this people jointly with equal sovereignty; let her serve a Phrygian husband and yield her Tyrians to your power as dowry!”

[105] To her – for she knew that with feigned purpose she had spoken, to turn the empire from Italy to Libya’s shores – Venus thus began in reply: “Who so mad as to refuse such terms, or prefer to strive against you in war, as long as Fortune favour the fulfilment of your word? But the Fates send me adrift, uncertain whether Jupiter wills that there be one city for the Tyrians and the wanderers from Troy, or approves the blending of peoples and the league of union. You are his wife; it is lawful for you to try to persuade his heart with entreaty. Go on; I will follow!” Then queenly Juno thus replied: “With me shall rest that task. Now in what way the present purpose can be achieved, hearken and I will explain in brief. Aeneas and unhappy Dido plan to go hunting together in the forest, as soon as tomorrow’s sun shows his rising and with his rays unveils the world. On them, while the hunters run to and fro and gird the glades with nets, I will pour down from above a black rain mingled with hail, and wake the whole welkin with thunder. The company shall scatter and be veiled in gloom of night; to the same cave shall come Dido and the Trojan chief. I will be there and, if I can be sure of your good will, will link them in sure wedlock, sealing her for his own; this shall be their bridal!” Yielding to her suit, the Cytherean gave assent and smiled at the guile discovered.

[129] Meanwhile Dawn rose and left the ocean. When sunlight has burst forth, there issues from the gates a chosen band of youth; with meshed nets, toils, broad-pointed hunting spears, there stream forth Massylian horsemen and their strong, keen-scented hounds. As the queen lingers in her bower, the Punic princes await her at the doorway; her prancing steed stands brilliant in purple and gold, and proudly champs the foaming bit. At last she comes forth, attended by a mighty throng, and clad in a Sidonian robe with embroidered border. Her quiver is of gold, her tresses are knotted into gold, a buckle of gold clasps her purple cloak. With her pace a Phrygian train and joyous Iulus. Aeneas himself, goodly beyond all others, advances to join her and unites his band with hers. As when Apollo quits Lycia, his winter home, and the streams of Xanthus, to visit his mother’s Delos, and renews the dance, while mingling about his altars Cretans and Dryopes and painted Agathyrsians raise their voices – he himself treads the Cynthian ridges, and with soft foliage shapes and binds his flowing locks, braiding it with golden diadem; the shafts rattle on his shoulders: so no less lightly than he went Aeneas, such beauty shines forth from his noble face! When they came to the mountain heights and pathless lairs, wild goats dislodged from the rocky peaks ran down the ridges; in another part stags scurry across the open moors and amid clouds of dust mass their bands in flight, as they leave the hills behind. But in the midst of the valleys the young Ascanius glories in his fiery steed, galloping past now these, now those, and prays that amid the timorous herds a foaming boar may be granted to his vows or a tawny lion come down from the mountain.

[160] Meanwhile in the sky begins the turmoil of a wild uproar; rain follows, mingled with hail. The scattered Tyrian train and the Trojan youth, with the Dardan grandson of Venus, in their fear seek shelter here and there over the fields; torrents rush down from the heights. To the same cave come Dido and the Trojan chief. Primal Earth and nuptial Juno give the sign; fires flashed in Heaven, the witness to their bridal, and on the mountaintop screamed the Nymphs. That day the first of death, the first of calamity was cause. For no more is Dido swayed by fair show or fair fame, no more does she dream of a secret love: she calls it marriage and with that name veils her sin.

[173] At once Rumour runs through Libya’s great cities – Rumour the swiftest of all evils. Speed lends her strength, and she winds vigour as she goes; small at first through fear, soon she mounts up to heaven, and walks the ground with head hidden in the clouds. Mother Earth, provoked to anger against the gods, brought her forth last, they, say as sister to Coeus and Enceladus, swift of foot and fleet of wing, a monster awful and huge, who for the many feathers in her body has as many watchful eyes beneath – wondrous to tell – as many tongues, as many sounding mouths, as many pricked-up ears. By night, midway between heaven and earth, she flies through the gloom, screeching, and droops not her eyes in sweet sleep; by day she sits on guard on high rooftop or lofty turrets, and affrights great cities, clinging to the false and the wrong, yet heralding truth. Now exulting in manifold gossip, she filled the nations and sang alike of fact and falsehood, how Aeneas is come, one born of Trojan blood, to whom in marriage fair Dido deigns to join herself; now they while away the winter, all its length, in wanton ease together, heedless of their realms and enthralled by shameless passion. These tales the foul goddess spreads here and there upon the lips of men. Straightway to King Iarbas she bends her course, and with her words fires his spirit and heaps high his wrath.

[198] He, the son of Hammon by a ravished Garamantian Nymph, set up to Jupiter in his broad realms a hundred vast temples, a hundred altars, and had hallowed the wakeful fire, the eternal sentry of the gods. The ground was fat with the blood of beasts and the portals bloomed with varied garlands. Distraught in mind and fired with the bitter tale, they say, before the altars and amid the divine presences he often besought Jove in prayer with upturned hands: “Almighty Jupiter, to whom now the Moorish race, feasting on embroidered couches, pour a Lenaean offering, do you see these things? Is it vainly, father, that we shudder at you, when you hurl your thunderbolts? And do aimless fires amid the clouds terrify our souls and stir murmurs void of purpose? This woman who, straying in our bounds, set up a tiny city at a price, to whom we gave coastland to plough and terms of tenure, has spurned my offers of marriage, and welcomed Aeneas into her realm as lord. And now that Paris with his eunuch train, his chin and perfumed locks bound with a Lydian turban, grasps the spoil; while we bring offerings to your temples, yours forsooth, and cherish an idle story.”

[219] As with such words he pleaded, clasping the altars, the Almighty gave ear and turned his eyes on the royal city and the lovers forgetful of their nobler fame. Then thus to Mercury he speaks and gives this charge: “Go forth, my son, call the Zephyrs, glide on they wings, and speak to the Dardan chief, who now at Carthage is looking forward to Tyrian cities, unmindful of those granted him by the Fates; so carry down my words through the swift winds. Not such as this did his lovely mother promise him to us, nor for this twice rescue him from Grecian arms; but he it was who should rule Italy, a land teeming with empire and clamorous with war, hand on a race from Teucer’s noble blood, and bring all the world beneath his laws. If the glory of such a fortune fires him not and for his own fame’s sake he shoulders not the burden, does he, the father, grudge Ascanius the towers of Rome? What is his plan? In what hope does he tarry among a hostile people and pays no heed to Ausonia\s race and the Lavinian fields? Let him set sail; this is the sum; be this the message from me.”

[238] He ceased. The god made ready to obey his mighty father’s bidding, and first binds on his feet the golden shoes which carry him upborne on wings over seas or land, swift as the gale. Then he takes his wand; with this he calls pale ghosts from Orcus and sends others down to gloomy Tartaurs, gives or takes away sleep and unseals eyes in death; relying on this, he drives the winds and skims the stormy clouds. And now in flight he descries the peak and steep sides of toiling Atlas, who props heaven on his peak – Atlas, whose pine-wreathed head is ever girt with black clouds, and beaten with wind and rain; fallen snow mantles his shoulders while rivers plunge down the aged chin and his rough beard is stiff with ice. Here, poised on even wings, the Cyllenian first halted; hence with his whole frame he sped sheer down to the waves like a bird, which round the shores, round the fish-haunted cliffs, flies low near to the waters. Even thus between earth and sky flew Cyllene’s nursling to Libya’s sandy shore, and cut the winds, coming from his mother’s sire.

[259] As soon as with winged feet he reached the huts, he sees Aeneas founding towers and building new houses. And his sword was starred with yellow jasper, and a cloak hung from his shoulders ablaze with Tyrian purple – a gift that wealthy Dido had wrought, interweaving the web with thread of gold. At once he assails him: “Are you now laying the foundations of lofty Carthage, and building up a fair city, and all for a woman’s whim? Alas! With never a thought of your own realm and fate! The ruler of the gods himself, who sways heaven and earth with his power, sends me down to you from bright Olympus. He himself bids me bring this charge through the swift breezes: What are you planning? In what hope do you waste idle hours in Libyan lands? If the glory of such a fortune does not stir you, and for your own fame’s sake you do not shoulder the burden, have regard from growing Ascanius, the promise of Iulus your heir, to whom the kingdom of Italy and the Roman land are due.” Such words the Cyllenian spoke, and while yet speaking left the sight of men and far away from their eyes vanished into thin air.
[279] But in truth Aeneas, aghast at he sight, was struck dumb; his hair stood up in terror and the voice choked in his throat. He burns to flee away and quit that pleasant land, awed by that warning and divine commandment. Ah, what to do? With what speech now dare he approach the frenzied queen? What opening words choose first? And as he casts his swift mind this way and that, takes it in different directions and considers every possibility, this, as he wavered, seemed the better counsel; he calls Mnestheus and Sergestus, bidding them make ready the fleet in silence, gather the crews to the shore, and order the armament, but hide the cause of his altered plans. He meanwhile, since gracious Dido knows nothing, nor expects the breaking of so strong a love, will essay an approach and seek the happiest season for speech, the plan auspicious for his purpose. At once all gladly obey his command and do his bidding.

[296] But the queen – who may deceive a lover? – divined his guile, and early caught news of the coming stir, fearful even when all was safe. The same heartless Rumour brought her the maddening news that they are arming the fleet and making ready for sailing. Helpless in mind she rages, and all aflame raves through the city, like some Thyiad startled by the shaken emblems, when she has heard the Bacchic cry: the biennial revels fire her and at night Cithaeron summons her with its din. At length she thus accosts Aeneas first:

[305] “’False one! Did you really hope to cloak so foul a crime, and to steal from my land in silence? Does neither our love restrain you, nor the pledge once given, nor the doom of a cruel death for Dido? Even in the winter season do you actually hasten to labour at your fleet, and to journey over the sea in the midst of northern gales, heartless one? What! If you were not in quest of alien lands and homes unknown, were ancient Troy yet standing, would Troy be sought by your ships over stormy seas? Is it from me you are fleeing? By these tears and your right hand, I pray you – since nothing else, alas, have I left myself – by the marriage that is ours, by the nuptial rites begun, if ever I deserved well of you, or if anything of mine has been sweet in your sight, pity a falling house, and if yet there be any room for prayers, put away, I pray, this purpose. Because of you the Libyan tribes and Numidian chiefs hate me, the Tyrians are my foes; because of you I have also lost my honour and that former fame by which alone I was winning a title to the stars. To whose mercy do you leave me on the point of death, guest – since that alone is left from the name of husband? Why do I linger? Is it till Pygmalion, my brother, overthrow this city, or the Gaetulian Iarbas lead me captive? At least, if before your flight a child of yours had been born to me, if in my hall a baby Aeneas were playing, whose face, in spite of all, would bring back yours, I should not think myself utterly vanquished and forlorn.”

[331] She ceased: he by Jove’s command held his eyes steadfast and with a struggle smothered the pain deep within his heart. At last he briefly replies: “I will never deny, Queen, that you have deserved of me the utmost you can set forth in speech, nor shall my memory of Elissa be bitter, while I have memory of myself, and while breath governs these limbs. For my conduct few words will I say. I did not hope – think not that – to veil my flight in stealth. I never held out a bridegroom’s torch or entered such a compact. Had destiny permitted me to shape my life after my own pleasure and order my sorrows at my own will, my first care would be the city of Troy and the sweet relics of my king. Priam’s high house would still abide and my own hand would have set up a revived Pergamus for the vanquished. But now of great Italy has Grynean Apollo bidden me lay hold, of Italy the Lycian oracles. There is my love, there my country! If the towers of Carthage and the sight of Libyan city charm you, a Phoenician, why, pray, grudge the Trojans their settling on Ausonian land? We, too, have the right to seek a foreign realm. Each time the night with dewy shades veils the earth, each time the starry fires arise, in my dreams my father Anchises’ troubled ghost brings me warning and terror; the thought of young Ascanius comes to me and the wrong done to one so dear, whom I am cheating of a Hesperian kingdom and predestined lands. Now, too, the messenger of the gods sent from Jove himself – I sear by both our lives – has borne his command down through the swift breezes; my own eyes saw the god in the clear light of day come within our walls and these ears drank in his words. Cease to inflame yourself and me with your complaints. It is not by my wish that I make for Italy . . . “

[362] As thus he spoke, all the while she gazes on him askance, turning her eyes to and fro, and with silent glances scans the whole man; then thus, inflamed, cries out: “False one, no goddess was your mother, nor was Dardanus the founder of your line, but rugged Caucasus on his flinty rocks begot you, and Hyrcanian tigresses suckled you. For why hide my feelings? For what greater wrongs do I hold myself back? Did he sigh while I wept? Did he turn on me a glance? Did he yield and shed tears or pity her who loved him? What shall I say first? What next? Now, neither mighty Juno nor the Saturnian sire looks on these things with righteous eyes! Nowhere is faith secure. I welcomed him, a castaway on the shore, a beggar, and madly gave him a share of my throne; his lost fleet I rescued, his crews I saved from death. Alas! I am whirled on the fires of frenzy. Now prophetic Apollo, now the Lycian oracles, now the messenger of the gods sent from Jove himself, brings through the air this dread command. Truly, this is work for gods, this is care to vex their peace! I detain you not; I dispute not your words. Go, make for Italy with the winds; seek your kingdom over the waves. Yet I trust, if the righteous gods have any power, that on the rocks midway you will drain the cup of vengeance and often call on Dido’s name. Though far away, I will chase you with murky brands and, when chill death has severed soul and body, everywhere my shade shall haunt you. Relentless one, you will repay! I shall hear, and the tale will reach me in the depths of the world below!” So saying, she breaks off her speech midway and flees in anguish from the light, turning away, tearing herself from his sight, and leaving him in fear and much hesitance, and ready to say much. Her maids support her, carry her swooning form to her marble bower, and lay her on her bed.

[393] But loyal Aeneas, though longing to soothe and assuage her grief and by his words turn aside her sorrow, with many a sigh, his soul shaken by his mighty love, yet fulfils Heaven’s bidding and returns to the fleet. Then, indeed, the Teucrians fall to and all along the shore launch their tall ships. The keels, well-pitched, are set afloat; the sailors, eager for flight, bring from the woods leafy boughs for oars and logs unhewn . . . One could see them moving away and streaming forth from all the city. Even as when ants, mindful of winter, plunder a huge heap of corn and store it in their home; over the plain moves a black column, and through the grass they carry the spoil on a narrow track; some strain with their shoulders and heave on the huge grains, some close up the ranks and rebuke the delay; all the path is aglow with work. What feelings then were yours, Dido, at such a sight! or what sighs did you utter, viewing from the top of the fortress the beach aglow far and near, and seeing before your eyes the whole sea astir with loud cries! O relentless Love, to what do you not drive the heats of men. Once more she must needs break into tears, once more assail him with prayer, and humbly bow down her pride to love, lest she leave anything untried and go to death in vain.

[416] “Anna, you see the bustle all along the shore; from all sides they have gathered; already the canvas invites the breeze, and the joyous sailors have crowned the stern with garlands. If I have had strength to foresee this great sorrow, I shall also, sister, have strength to endure it. Yet this one service, Anna, do for me – for you alone that traitor made his friend, to you he confided even his secret thoughts, you alone will know the hour for easy access to him – go, sister, and humbly address our haughty foe. I never conspired with the Danaans at Aulis to root out the Trojan race; I never sent a fleet to Pergamus, nor tore up the ashes and disturbed the spirit of his father Anchises. Why does he refuse to admit my words to his stubborn ears? Whither does he hasten? This, the last boon, let him grant his poor lover: let him await an easy flight and favouring winds. No more do I plead for the old marriage tie which he forswore, nor that he give up fair Latium and resign his realm: for empty time I ask, for peace and reprieve for my frenzy, till fortune teach my vanquished soul to grieve. This last grace I crave – pity your sister – which, when he has granted it, I will repay with full interest in my death.”

[437] Such was her prayer and such the tearful pleas the unhappy sister bears again and again. But by no tearful pleas is he moved, nor in yielding mood does he pay heed to any words. Fate withstands and heaven seals his kindly, mortal ears. Even as when northern Alpine winds, blowing now hence, now thence, emulously strive to uproot an oak strong with the strength of years, there comes a roar, the trunk quivers and the high leafage thickly strews the ground, but the oak clings to the crag, and as far as it lifts its top to the airs of heaven, so far it strikes its roots down towards hell – even so with ceaseless appeals, from this side and from that, the hero is buffeted, and in his mighty heart feels agony: his mind stands steadfast; his tears fall without effect.

[450] Then, indeed, awed by her doom, luckless Dido prays for death; she is weary of gazing on the arch of heaven. And to make her more surely fulfil her purpose and leave the light, she saw, as she laid her gifts on the altars ablaze with incense – fearful to tell – the holy water darken and the outpoured wine change into loathsome gore. Of this sight she spoke to no one – not even her sister. Moreover, there was in the palace a marble chapel to her former lord, which she cherished in wondrous honour, wreathing it with snowy fleeces and festal foliage. Thence she heard, it seemed, sounds and speech as of her husband calling, whenever darkling night held the world; and alone on the housetops with ill-boding song the owl would oft complain, drawing out its lingering notes into a wail; and likewise many a saying of the seers of old terrifies her with fearful boding. In her sleep fierce Aeneas himself drives her in her frenzy; and ever she seems to be left lonely, ever ending, companionless, an endless way, and seeking her Tyrians in a land forlorn – even as raving Pentheus sees the Bacchants’ bands, and a double sun and two-fold Thebes rise to view; or as when Agamemnon’s son, Orestes, hounded by the Furies, flees from his mother, who is armed with brands and black serpents, while at the doorway crouch avenging Fiends.

[474] So when, outworn with anguish, she caught the madness and resolved to die, in her own heart she determines the time and manner, and accosts her sorrowful sister, with mien that veils her plan and on her brow a cloudless hope. “Sister mine, I have found a way – wish your sister joy – to return him to me or release me from my love for him. Near Ocean’s bound and the setting sun lies Ethiopia, farthest of lands, where mightiest Atlas on this shoulders turns the sphere, inset with gleaming stars. Thence a priestess of Massylian race has been shown me, warden of the fane of the Hesperides, who gave dainties to the dragon and guarded the sacred bows on the tree, sprinkling dewy honey and slumberous poppies. With her spells she professes to set free the hearts of whom she wills, but on others to bring cruel love pains; to stay the flow of rivers and turn back the stars; she awakes the ghosts of night; and you will see earth rumbling under your feet and ash trees coming down the mountains. I call heaven to witness and you, dear sister mine, and your dear life, that against my will I arm myself with magic arts! Secretly raise up a pyre in the inner court under the sky, and heap up on it’s the arms that heartless one left hanging in my bower, and all his attire and the bridal bed that was my undoing. I want to destroy all memorials of the abhorred wretch, and the priestess to directs.” Thus she speaks and is silent; pallor the while overspreads her face. Yet Anna thinks not that her sister veils her death under these strange rites; her mind dreams not of such frenzy nor does she fear anything worse than when Sychaeus died. So she makes ready as bidden . . .

[505] But the queen, when in the heart of her home the pyre rose heavenward, piled high with pine logs and hewn ilex, hangs the place with garlands and crowns it with funeral boughs. On top, upon the couch, she lays the dress he wore, the sword he left, and an image of him, knowing what was to come. Round about stand altars, and with streaming hair the priestess calls in thunder tones on thrice a hundred gods, Erebos and Chaos, and threefold Hecate, triple-faced maiden Diana. Waters, too, she had sprinkled feigned to be from the spring of Avernus, and herbs were sought, cut by moonlight with brazen sickles, and juicy with milk of black venom; sought, too, was the love charm, torn from the brow of a colt at birth before the mother snatched it . . . She herself, with holy meal and holy hands, stood beside the altars, one for unsandalled and girdle loosened; soon to die, she calls on the gods and on the stars, witnesses of her doom; then she prays to whatever power, righteous and mindful, watches over lovers unequally allied.

[522] It was night, and over the earth weary creatures were tasting the peace of slumber; the woods and wild seas had sunk to rest – the hour when stars roll midway in their gliding course, when all the land is still, and beasts and coloured birds, both those that far and near haut the limpid lakes, and those that dwell in the thorny thickets of the countryside, are couched in sleep beneath the silent night. They were soothing their cares, their hearts oblivious of sorrows. But not so the soul-racked Phoenician queen; she never sinks into sleep, nor draws darkness into eyes or heart. Her pangs redouble, and her love, swelling up, surges afresh, as she heaves with a mighty tide of passion. Thus then she begins, and thus alone revolves her thoughts in her heart: “See, hwat am I do do? Shall I once more make trial of my old wooers, only to be mocked, and shall I humbly sue for marriage with Numidians, whom I have scorned so often as husbands? Shall I then follow the Ilian ships and the Trojan’s uttermost commands? Is it because they are thankful for aid once given, and gratitude for past kindness stands firm in their mindful hearts? But who – suppose that I wished it – will suffer me, or take on so hated on those haughty ships? Ah! lost one, do you not yet understand nor perceive the treason of Laomedon’s race? What then? Shall I on my own accompany the exultant sailors in their flight? Or, surrounded by all my Tyrian band, shall I pursue, and shall I again drive seaward the men whom I could scarce tear from the Sidonian city, and bid them unfurl their sails to the winds? Nay, die as you deserve, and with the sword end your sorrow. Won over by my tears, you, my sister, you were the first to load my frenzied soul with these ills, and drive me on the foe. Ah, that I could not spend my life apart from wedlock, a blameless life, like some wild creature, and not know such cares! The faith vowed to the ashes of Sychaeus I have not kept.” Such were the cries that kept bursting from her heart.

[554] But now that all was duly ordered, and now that he was resolved on going, Aeneas was snatching sleep on his vessel’s high stern. In his sleep there appeared to him a vision of the god, as he came again with the same aspect, and once more seemed to warn him thus, in all aspects like Mercury, in voice and colouring, in golden hair and the graceful limbs of youth: “Goddess-born, when such hazard threatens, can you still slumber? Do you not see the perils that from henceforth hem you in, madman? Do you not hear the kindly breezes blowing? She, resolved on death, revolves in her heart fell craft and crime, and awakens the swirling surge of passion. Will you not flee hence in haste, while hasty flight is possible? Soon you will see the waters a welter of timbers, see fierce brands ablaze, and soon the shore flashing with flames, if dawn finds you lingering in these lands. Up then, break off delay! A fickle and changeful thing is woman ever.” So he spoke and melted into the black night.
[571] Thus indeed Aeneas, scared by the sudden vision, tears himself from sleep and bestirs his comrades. “Make haste, my men, awake and man the benches! Unfurl the sails with speed! A god sent from high heaven again spurs us to hasten our flight and cut the twisted cables. We follow you, holy among gods, whoever you are, and again joyfully obey your command. Oh, be with us, give your gracious aid, and in the sky vouchsafe kindly stars!” He spoke, and from its sheath snatches his flashing sword and strikes the hawser with the drawn blade. The same zeal catches all at once; with hurry and scurry they have quitted the shore; the sea is hidden under their fleets; lustily they churn the foam and sweep the blue waters.

[584] And now early Dawn, leaving the saffron bed of Tithonus, was sprinkling her fresh rays upon the earth. Soon as the queen from her watchtower saw the light whiten and the fleet move on with even sails, and knew the shores and harbours were void of oarsmen, thrice and four times she struck her comely breast with her hand, and tearing her golden hair, “O God,” she cries, “shall he go? Shall the intruder have made of our realm a laughingstock? Will pursuers not fetch arms and give chase from all the city, and some of them speed ships from the docks? Go, haste to bring fire, serve arms, ply oars! What say I? Where am I? What madness turns my brain? Unhappy Dido, do only now your sinful deeds come home to you? Then was the time, when you gave your crown away. Behold the pledge and promise of him who, so they say, carries wit him his ancestral gods and bore his worn-out father on his shoulders! Could I not have seized him, torn him limb from limb, and scattered the pieces on the waves? Could I not have put his men to the sword, and Ascanius himself, and served him up as a meal at his father’s table? But perhaps the issue of battle had been doubtful? Suppose it had been: doomed to death, whom had I to fear? I should have carried fire to his camp, filled his decks with flame, blotted out father and son together with the whole race, and immolated myself on top of all. O Sun, whose rays survey all that is done on earth; and Juno, agent and witness of unhappy love; Hecate, whose name is wailed by night in city streets; and Avenging Furies and gods of dying Elissa: hear me now; turn your anger upon the sins that merit it, and listen to my prayers! If that accursed wretch must needs reach harbour and come to shore, if Jove’s ordinances so demand and this is the outcome fixed: yet even so, harassed in war by the arms of a fearless nation, expelled from his territory and torn from Iulus’ embrace, let him plead for aid an see his friends cruelly slaughtered! Nor yet, when he has submitted to the terms of an unjust peace, may he enjoy his kingship or the life he longs for, but perish before his time and lie unburied on a lonely strand! This is my prayer; this last utterance I pour out with my blood. Then do you, Tyrians, persecute with hate his stock and all the race to come, and to my dust offer this tribute! Let no lover or treaty unite the nations! Arise from my ashes, unknown avenger, to harass the Trojan settlers with fire and sword – today, hereafter, whenever strength be ours! May coast with coast conflict, I pray, and sea with sea, arms with arms; war may they have, themselves and their children’s children!”

[630] With this curse she turned her mind in every direction, seeking how most quickly to end the life she loathed. Then briefly she addressed Barce, the nurse of Sychaeus, for the pyre’s black ashes held her own back in her country of long ago. “Dear nurse, bring my sister Anna here. Bid her hasten to sprinkle her body with river water and bring with her the victims and offerings ordained for atonement. This done, let her come; and veil your brows, too, with a pure chaplet. I am minded to fulfil the rites of Stygian Jove that I have duly ordered and begun, to put an end to my owes, and give over to the flames the pyre of that Dardan wretch.” She spoke; the nurse hastened her steps with an old woman’s zeal. But Dido, trembling and frantic with her dreadful design, rolling bloodshot eyes, her quivering cheeks flecked with burning spots, and pale at the imminence of death, bursts into the inner courts of the house, climbs the high pyre in a frenzy and unsheathes the Dardan sword, a gift south for no such purpose. Then, as she saw the Trojan garb and the familiar bed, pausing awhile in tearful thought, she threw herself on the couch and spoke her last words: “O relics once dear, while God and Fate allowed, take my spirit, and release me from my woes! My life is done and I have finished the course that Fortune gave; and now in majesty my shade shall pass beneath the earth. A noble city I have built; my own walls I have seen; avenging my husband, I have exacted punishment from my brother and foe – happy, too happy, had but the Dardan keels never touched our shores!” She spoke, and burying her face in the couch, “I shall die unavenged,” she cries, “but let me die! Thus, I go gladly into the dark! Let the cruel Dardan’s eyes drink in this fire from the deep, and carry with him the omen of my death!”

[663] She ceased; and even as she spoke her handmaids see her fallen on the sword, the blade reeking with blood and her hands bespattered. A scream rises to the lofty roof; Rumour riots through the stricken city. The palace rings with lamentation, with sobbing and women’s shrieks, and heaven echoes with loud wails – as though all Carthage or ancient Tyre were falling before the inrushing foe, and fierce flames were rolling on over the roofs of men, over the roofs of gods.

[672] Swooning, her sister heard, and in dismay rushed through the throng, tearing her face with her nails, and beating her breast with her fists, as she called on the dying woman by name. “Was this your purpose, sister? Did you aim your fraud at me? Was this for me the meaning of your pyre, this the meaning of your altar and fires? Forlorn, what shall I first lament? Did you scorn in death your sister’s company? You should have summoned me to share your fate; the same sword stroke, the same moment would have taken us both! Did these hands indeed build the pyre, and did my voice call on our father’s gods, in order that, when you were lying thus, I, cruel one, should be far away? You have destroyed yourself and me together, sister, the Sidonian senate and people, and your city! Bring me water to bathe her wounds and catch with my lips whatever last breath may linger!” Thus speaking, she had climbed the high steps, and, throwing her arms round her dying sister, sobbed and clasped her to her bosom, stanching with her dress the dark streams of blood. She, trying to lift her heavy eyes, swoons again, and the deep-set wound gurgles in her breast. Thrice rising, she struggles to prop herself on her elbow, thrice the bed rolled back, with wandering eyes sought high heaven’s light, and when she found it, moaned.

[693] Then almighty Juno, pitying her long agony and painful dying, sent Iris down from heaven to release her struggling soul from the prison of her flesh. For since she perished neither in the course of fate nor by a death she had earned, but wretchedly before her day, in the heat of sudden frenzy, not yet had Propserpine taken from head the golden lock and consigned her to the Stygian underworld. So Iris on dewy saffron wings flits down through the sky, trailing athwart the sun a thousand shifting tints, and halted above her head. “This offering, sacred to Dis, I take as bidden, and from your body set you free”: so she speaks and with her hand severs the lock; and therewith all the warmth passed away, and the life vanished into the winds.Embed"

Shit ain’t the same
Niggas don’t wanna stay in they own lane
I’m doing alright I’m good I can’t complain
‘Bout a piece of pussy they going against the grain
The sun shining I’m prepared for the rain
You mad I’m late but be glad that I came
That ain’t blood on my shirt bitch I’m covered in stains
Like let me explain
No Batman and Robin I was really robbing
Like I ain’t have a option
Stick up kid rob the plug now I’m running plays like the auction
If I fuck around and get jammed would you write me?
Would you make sure my commissary straight that’s unlikely
I don’t even know why I bothered to ask
I might grab the K and just spaz
I really’ll give my niggas my last
If I was down bad, would you ride ‘til the wheels fell off with expired tags?
I lost my brother an it hurt
But what hurt worse
Is watching my mother shed tears ‘cause her oldest child in a hearse
But that ain’t the half shit get deeper
I hide the pain like I’m holding up strong
Really, I’m getting weaker and weaker and weaker
I had to come to my senses get my shit together
Popped a perky I feel a little better
Devil trying to take me under won’t let him
You can run from the pain
But you damn sure can’t hide
‘Cause I promise it’s gone eat yo’ ass up inside
I got three daughters I gotta provide
Ain’t no pressure like it wasn’t applied
Mary J Blige not gonna cry
Knowing that we fighting to live just to die

An I swear shit ain’t been the same since I lost my brother
I’ve been trying to hide the pain but it’s like you can still see it in living color
An I swear I lost it all ‘cause all we had was each other
You weren’t there so how could you tell me things gonna be better
I swallow my pride
I wiped my eyes
I said I ain’t gone cry
Not in front of my daughters gotta set an example
I can’t lie I tried
I broke down couldn’t hold it inside
We fighting to live just to die
Ain’t no pressure like it wasn’t applied
An I can’t lie shit ain’t like it use to be
An usually I don’t let what the next nigga do influence me
Since my brother told me money talk
Its like I speak it fluently
Running from my past when it catch me what its gone do to me

Verse 2
Those cold nights in a cell
No visitation
Sunny days just precipitation
Fifteen minute phone calls wasted
In the midst of fighting all these cases
I realized who the fuck gone be out there for my babies
Nobody but me
Only the strong survive
Make your mind up decide
You fell in love like Bonnie and Clyde
I ran up a check I’m in full stride
You can be here one day and gone the next
Don’t do something that you know you gone regret
I ain’t get to tell my brother that I love him
Now I’m mad at the world, upset
I thank God that I made it
Twenty odd years rip and running these streets
Go out bad is you crazy
I feel like Tyrese Gibson I’m waste deep
Speaking on the next man situation ain’t one hunna’
The devil devoured the flower my heart crumbled
I’ma fuck around and go crazy
Why do we live?
Why do we die?
What is the purpose?
Suicidal thoughts like is this shit really worth it
What the fuck did I do to deserve this
Hold ya head high when that bullshit start to surface
I’m trying to stay strong for my mama but the shit just ain’t working
Chorus
An I swear shit ain’t been the same since I lost my brother
I’ve been trying to hide the pain but it’s like you can still see it in living color
An I swear I lost it all ‘cause all we had was each other
You weren’t there so how could you tell me things gonna be better
I swallow my pride

If all the heavy falls on me

Paying for free
Caught in a zipper on the lips

And you jumped over a cow

Hey baby, how you doin'?
Wow, it's really been a long time, you know?
Remember that night?
You remember

[Verse 1: Teena Marie]
On a starry winter night in Portugal
Where the ocean kissed the southern shore
There a dream I never thought would come to pass
Came and went like time slipped through an hourglass

You made love to me like fire and rain
Ooh, you know you got to be a hurricane
Killing me with kisses so so subtly
You made love forever, baby
You made love forever

My love and I did meet
She crossed the salley gardens
With little snow-white feet

She bid me to take life easy
As the leaves grow on the tree

And with her I did not agree

In a field down by the river
My love and I did stand
And upon my leaning shoulder
She laid her snow-white hand

She bid me take life easy

There's stars we can wish upon, at the setting of the sun
The sunsets we can cry over, put our trouble's on the run

And one sad day I found myself in trouble, way down without a friend
Along came the love of a real good woman, said she'd love me 'til the end

If you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

[Verse 2]
And if you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

[Bridge]
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch

[Verse 3]
Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

In my world, I wasn't prepared
And what I witnessed from your heart
'Cause I knew, baby girl, it was ready to start
A fantasy that was oh-so true

In this world full of love, you were made for me

'Cause I'd do anything for you, don't you see?

Baby girl, in my fantasy

Spring is here, so blow your job
Throw your job away

Now's the time to trust to your wanderlust
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait

In our mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together

While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet
When it rains, we'll laugh at the weather

And if you're good
I'll search for wood
So you can cook while I stand looking

pos,"1 ContributorThe Diary of a Nobody (Chapter XII) LyricsA serious discussion concerning the use and value of my diary. Lupin’s opinion of ’Xmas. Lupin’s unfortunate engagement is on again.

December 17.—As I open my scribbling diary I find the words “Oxford Michaelmas Term ends.” Why this should induce me to indulge in retrospective I don’t know, but it does. The last few weeks of my diary are of minimum interest. The breaking off of the engagement between Lupin and Daisy Mutlar has made him a different being, and Carrie a rather depressing companion. She was a little dull last Saturday, and I thought to cheer her up by reading some extracts from my diary; but she walked out of the room in the middle of the reading, without a word. On her return, I said: “Did my diary bore you, darling?”

She replied, to my surprise: “I really wasn’t listening, dear. I was obliged to leave to give instructions to the laundress. In consequence of some stuff she puts in the water, two more of Lupin’s coloured shirts have run and he says he won’t wear them.”

I said: “Everything is Lupin. It’s all Lupin, Lupin, Lupin. There was not a single button on my shirt yesterday, but I made no complaint.”

Carrie simply replied: “You should do as all other men do, and wear studs. In fact, I never saw anyone but you wear buttons on the shirt-fronts.”

I said: “I certainly wore none yesterday, for there were none on.”

Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the evening, and Cummings never does. I fear they don’t get on well with Lupin.

December 18.—Yesterday I was in a retrospective vein—to-day it is prospective. I see nothing but clouds, clouds, clouds. Lupin is perfectly intolerable over the Daisy Mutlar business. He won’t say what is the cause of the breach. He is evidently condemning her conduct, and yet, if we venture to agree with him, says he won’t hear a word against her. So what is one to do? Another thing which is disappointing to me is, that Carrie and Lupin take no interest whatever in my diary.

I broached the subject at the breakfast-table to-day. I said: “I was in hopes that, if anything ever happened to me, the diary would be an endless source of pleasure to you both; to say nothing of the chance of the remuneration which may accrue from its being published.”

Both Carrie and Lupin burst out laughing. Carrie was sorry for this, I could see, for she said: “I did not mean to be rude, dear Charlie; but truly I do not think your diary would sufficiently interest the public to be taken up by a publisher.”

I replied: “I am sure it would prove quite as interesting as some of the ridiculous reminiscences that have been published lately. Besides, it’s the diary that makes the man. Where would Evelyn and Pepys have been if it had not been for their diaries?”

Carrie said I was quite a philosopher; but Lupin, in a jeering tone, said: “If it had been written on larger paper, Guv., we might get a fair price from a butterman for it.”

As I am in the prospective vein, I vow the end of this year will see the end of my diary.
December 19.—The annual invitation came to spend Christmas with Carrie’s mother—the usual family festive gathering to which we always look forward. Lupin declined to go. I was astounded, and expressed my surprise and disgust. Lupin then obliged us with the following Radical speech: “I hate a family gathering at Christmas. What does it mean? Why someone says: ‘Ah! we miss poor Uncle James, who was here last year,’ and we all begin to snivel. Someone else says: ‘It’s two years since poor Aunt Liz used to sit in that corner.’ Then we all begin to snivel again. Then another gloomy relation says ‘Ah! I wonder whose turn it will be next?’ Then we all snivel again, and proceed to eat and drink too much; and they don’t discover until I get up that we have been seated thirteen at dinner.”

December 20.—Went to Smirksons’, the drapers, in the Strand, who this year have turned out everything in the shop and devoted the whole place to the sale of Christmas cards. Shop crowded with people, who seemed to take up the cards rather roughly, and, after a hurried glance at them, throw them down again. I remarked to one of the young persons serving, that carelessness appeared to be a disease with some purchasers. The observation was scarcely out of my mouth, when my thick coat-sleeve caught against a large pile of expensive cards in boxes one on top of the other, and threw them down. The manager came forward, looking very much annoyed, and picking up several cards from the ground, said to one of the assistants, with a palpable side-glance at me: “Put these amongst the sixpenny goods; they can’t be sold for a shilling now.” The result was, I felt it my duty to buy some of these damaged cards.

I had to buy more and pay more than intended. Unfortunately I did not examine them all, and when I got home I discovered a vulgar card with a picture of a fat nurse with two babies, one black and the other white, and the words: “We wish Pa a Merry Christmas.” I tore up the card and threw it away. Carrie said the great disadvantage of going out in Society and increasing the number of our friends was, that we should have to send out nearly two dozen cards this year.

December 21.—To save the postman a miserable Christmas, we follow the example of all unselfish people, and send out our cards early. Most of the cards had finger-marks, which I did not notice at night. I shall buy all future cards in the daytime. Lupin (who, ever since he has had the appointment with a stock and share broker, does not seem over-scrupulous in his dealings) told me never to rub out the pencilled price on the backs of the cards. I asked him why. Lupin said: “Suppose your card is marked 9d. Well, all you have to do is to pencil a 3—and a long down-stroke after it—in front of the ninepence, and people will think you have given five times the price for it.”

In the evening Lupin was very low-spirited, and I reminded him that behind the clouds the sun was shining. He said: “Ugh! it never shines on me.” I said: “Stop, Lupin, my boy; you are worried about Daisy Mutlar. Don’t think of her any more. You ought to congratulate yourself on having got off a very bad bargain. Her notions are far too grand for our simple tastes.” He jumped up and said: “I won’t allow one word to be uttered against her. She’s worth the whole bunch of your friends put together, that inflated, sloping-head of a Perkupp included.” I left the room with silent dignity, but caught my foot in the mat.

December 23.—I exchanged no words with Lupin in the morning; but as he seemed to be in exuberant spirits in the evening, I ventured to ask him where he intended to spend his Christmas. He replied: “Oh, most likely at the Mutlars’.”

In wonderment, I said: “What! after your engagement has been broken off?”

Lupin said: “Who said it is off?”

I said: “You have given us both to understand—”

He interrupted me by saying: “Well, never mind what I said. It is on again—there!”Embed"

Crying for mama's arms
At an orphanage just outside a little China town
Where the forgotten are

But half a world away I hang the stockings by the fire
And dream about the day when I can finally call you mine

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

As I hang the tinsel on the tree and watch the twinkling lights
I'm warmed by the fire's glow
Outside the children tumble in the wonderland of white
And make angels in the snow

But half a world away you try your best to fight the tears
And hope that Heaven's Angels come to carry you here

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart

My higher reason will take aim

We are not alone, we share our stake
And I think the winter will be wonderful

To all the roll or drop the weight

Wasn't expecting you so soon but

Unselfish love is what you bring
Boy, I'm so glad you're here in my life

Just because you came along
My heart was singing all sad love songs

And like a bolt of lightning

Lose myself in love ..

I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all i ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all i ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Try to make me feel like i was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me no!

I had to lose myself so i could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Love you better, lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is?

Couldn?t tell me i was in love when i needed it
When, all i ever wanted was love
Should a told me i was worth receiving it
But all i ever wanted was love
There?s something awkward about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see!

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And i couldn?t love you perfectly with that fear in my head
So i perilously had to face the danger
So i could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul i said!
So i could make it better

I had to lose myself had to lose myself
So i could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Make it better

Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is

And so it goes that i never meant to hurt you
Couldn?t stay but i never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things i just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot of years i suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years i can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind!
I had to lose myself so i could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Love you better baby better baby
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So i could love you better baby
Had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could love you better baby

I once knew a girl in the years of my youth
With eyes like the summer, all beauty and truth
But in the morning I fled, left a note and it read:
""Someday you will be loved""

[Verse 2]
I cannot pretend that I felt any regret
'Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
And as the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved

You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
'Cause someday you will be loved

You may feel alone when you're falling asleep
And every time tears roll down your cheeks
But I know your heart belongs to someone you've yet to meet
And someday you will be loved

You've given love a brand new meaning
Bound by a higher power than I've ever known before

Ain’t it strange
How everybody says I love you
Ain’t it a shame
How a word can't tell you more than words can say
I need you here
Ain’t it strange
‘Cause I’m always thinkin' of ya
Ain’t it a shame
How a thought can catch the breeze and blow away
I need you here

[Chorus]
Oh, but I know how bad it can get (How bad it can get)
But I don’t mind
Baby, I don’t mind (I, I don't mind)
But I know how soon you’ll forget me (Soon we'll forget)
But time keeps blaring
Baby, time takes care of me

[Verse 2]
Ain't it strange
How a man who lives for nothing can change
'Cause if he stays the same he’ll die a million days
Year by year
There’s a drain
At the bottom of the ocean
And when it rains
We'll get close to where the water meets the sky
For you and I

Oh, but I don’t know how far this could go (Bad, bad it can get)

Baby, I don't mind (I don't mind)
There's no use in sayin'
That you've been sprayin'
But even strangers know how strange it can be (in love)

We're only getting old
'Cause that's what we are told to do
But they sang to get through
But what's that got to do with us?
So go on and work it out

When we laugh indoors
The blissful tones bounce off the walls and fall to the ground
Peel the hardwood back to let them loose
From decades trapped and listen so still
This city is my home, construction noise all day long
And gutter punks are bumming change
So, I breed thicker skin and let my lustrous coat fill in
And I'll never admit

Some kind of plastic, some kind of plastic

They wear phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates

As though I'm moving to the end
Am I moving to the end of your loving?

How, how did I do this?
Me, I put the wall around my heart
Why didn't I notice such cold detachment from the start?
Oh, the jaws they slammed down
And the one in this town burns bright enough

Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
I could feel forever the same
Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
I could feel forever the same

So how, how did I do this?
Oh, me I put that box around my heart
Why couldn't I notice such a cool detachment from the start?
Oh, the joys they slammed down
From the one in this town burns bright enough

Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
I could feel forever the same
Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
Yeah I could feel forever the same

Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you

[Verse 2]
I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

[Verse 1]
On the bank of the river
Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So, their love could never be

[Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

[Verse 2]
He couldn't swim the raging river
'Cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach Little White Dove
Waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her
Throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her brave

Through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met
The raging river pulled them down

In that happy huntin' ground

To tell me which way I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant your love and let it grow

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

[Verse 2]
Looking for a reason to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on
But there's nothing left to show
Plant your love and let it grow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get what you are needing
The rest is up to you
Plant your love and let it grow

You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this
Long and winding road

Tonight, tonight

Falling off the silver screen

For the whole world to read

Last night, I felt the skies open up and rain down heaven

Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings
Last night, I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing
Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony
While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free

I couldn't get a thing to go just right
I was hangin' by my thumb and slippin' on my feet
I had to take a break I couldn't stand the heat
Just when I thought I could never win
I was doing pretty good for the shape I was in

I went to the movies last night again
I couldn't stay long enough to see the end
'Cause there was something going on that I couldn't see
Everybody's making out in the balcony
I was missing out on the fun again
But I'm doing pretty good for the shape I'm in

I tried so hard to get back in the race
I'd just be satisfied if I could place
There's so much competition but the best don't always win
I'm doing pretty good for the shape I'm in

I went to a party and made a few passes
One was a dream and the other was nasty
Well, I guess you know by now that I did it again
But I was doing pretty good for the shape I was in

If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Verse 1: Musiq Soulchild]
Girl I'm so surprised to see
The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400-SE
Even your attitude flows pleasantly
I remember when you was just Tonya Hall
A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concerned, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours, but...

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you

I'm happy to see that you're home from school
And I wanna let you know that I'm proud of you
Even when we was younger, I admired you
That's why I used to always pick fights with you
I remember when we used to call each other names
Mimic old tv shows and play those childish games
Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane
Can we do that nowadays?

I know it's out of fashion
And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down

[Chorus]
From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

[Verse 2]
On a silent summer evening
The sky's alive with lights
A building in the distance
Surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach
There's not a soul around

One little Christmas tree was standing alone
Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky

Oh please Mr. Father tree, the tallest of all
I'm so afraid and so alone
Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small
Light up someone's home 'cause

[Chorus]
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy

[Verse 2]
One little angel who was riding a star
Cried as she looked down at the tree
Oh please Mr. Father tree wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me

Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world
Go down little angel girl and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world 'cause

When you dressed up sharp
And you felt all right?

With a chick who'd go
And listen to the music
On the radio

A saxophone was blowin'
On a rock 'n' roll show
You climbed in the back seat
Really had a good time

Tonight she really was mine

Get back in front
Put some hair oil on

His very last song

With your arms around your girl
You try to sing along
You felt pretty good. Woo!

She's like a little bird
She flies from A to B
To see what she can see
She's far away from me

We danced on the moon
We danced by the sea
The land of blue gold
Is where we were free

[Chorus]

Where we were free

The shiny blackest crow
Flew in to say hello
Though much to her surprise
He had two mouths for eyes

That crow was very pleased
He gave to her his wings
And now she is free

Only air flying emotionless
Ring the bells for she could keep flying
This is me, completely me

End of day, we watched the sun go down
But I can see, you're like a firework
You wanna save me, people will save me
But this is you, completely you

Now it's day but I am dreaming
A man walks by, I want to be his wife
I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only good sometimes
Taking my time to go home

Like a candle wasted from burning
I got shoes tired from walking
Calling out your name, my lips keep failing
They have now forgot to sing

Now it's day but I am dreaming
A man walks by, I want to be his wife
I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only good sometimes

Well you better listen my sister's and brothers

There are voices still calling across the years
And they're all crying across the ocean
And they're crying across the land

None of us are free, if one of us are chained
None of us are free

And there are people still in darkness
And they just can't see the light

We got try to feel for each other, let our brother's know that we care
Got to get the message, send it out loud and clear

While Abraham shaped your sigh

Or am I sleeping in clover tonight?
