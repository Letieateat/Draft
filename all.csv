Yo se bien que estoy afuera, pero el día que yo me muera
Se que tendrás que llorar, dirás que no me quisiste
Pero vas a estar muy triste, y así te vas a quedar

Con dinero y sin dinero, hago siempre lo que quiero
Y mi palabra es la ley, no tengo trono ni reyna
Ni nadie que me comprenca, pero sigo siendo el rey

Despues me dijo un arriero
Que no hay que llegar primero
Pero hay que saber llegar

If ever words were spoken painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life, all I wanted
Was the keeping of someone like you
As it turns out, deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you
Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love

I'd been the tempting one stole her from herself
This gift in pain, her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you
I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

[Chorus]

You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break

What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said, ""Peace could last forever""?
And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

[Chorus]
And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
You're power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store

And I don't wanna hear no more
[Verse 3]
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

Lost forever in your disapproving glance

Falling from grace
You deserve what you got

You can't pretend

I've seen the pain
And all the evil you brought

Quit your fucking crying
And swallow all your pills
Your not the only one

Grab the dusty bottle
And let the liquor spill
Devoid of life
Death is your final thrill

Can see right through the selfish lies

Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation: an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again

Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within

Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect

My declaration embedded deep under the skin

And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed
'Cause if you're trying to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well my dear

[Verse 3]
Now every one of us was made to suffer
Every one of us was made to weep
But we've been hurting one another
And now the pain has cut too deep
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking (don't let me keep on walking)
I can't keep on walking (keep on walking on)
Keep on walking on broken glass

[Chorus]
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass2Embed"

I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door

Er war ein Punker und er lebte in der großen Stadt

Er hatte Schulden, denn er trank, doch ihn liebten alle Frauen
Und jede rief: „Come and rock me Amadeus!“
Er war Superstar, er war populär
Er war so exaltiert, because er hatte Flair
Er war ein Virtuose, war ein Rockidol

I've felt so self assured
But suddenly it's all changed
She's a cloud
That hangs above my world
And I find myself wandering in the rain
And now I can't go on

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I need her guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young, and time was on my side
But like a fool I let it slip away
And now those days are gone

And I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams

And some other woman is looking like somethin'

Since you've been gone
I feel my life slipping away
I look to the sky
And everything is turnin' gray
All I made was one mistake
How much more will I have to pay
Why can't you think it over
Why can't you forget about the past

[Chorus]
When love makes a sound, babe
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down, babe
Can't you see I love you
Since you've been gone, I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye

[Verse 2]
So this is love
Standing in the pouring rain
I fooled on you
But she never meant a thing
And I know I ain't got no right
To ask you to sympathize
But why can't you think it over

She calls me up and says baby it's a lonely ol' night
I don't know I'm just so scared and lonely all at the same time
Nobody told us it was gonna work out this way
No, no, no, no, no
I guess they knew we'd work it out in our own way

Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

He's singing about standing in the shadows of love
I guess he feels awfully alone
She says I know exactly what he means
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's a sad, sad, sad, sad feeling
When you're living on those in-betweens
But it's okay

I begin to think I understand
Anything we are
You and I have always been ever and ever

I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do, always takes me home to you
Ever and ever

Now I know my life has given me
More than memories
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
Sweet love flowin' almost every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it...right

Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are you and I were meant to be
Forever and ever

I think about the times to come
Knowin' I will be the lucky one
Ever our love will last

Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide

A love that seemed strong was not meant to be
Broken hearts don't always mend
Left too unsure to try love again

But, just between you and me
Baby, I know our love will be

Hearts can be blind to love gone astray
Always it's the same old song
Someone's been hurt by a love that's gone wrong

Atreyu,Lip Gloss And Black,neg,"11 ContributorsLip Gloss and Black Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I gave you pretty enough words
Could you paint a picture of us that works?
An emphasis on function rather than design
Aren't you tired? Cause I will carry you on a broken back
And blown out knees
I have been where you are for a while

[Chorus]
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night, every evening that I die

[Bridge]
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human

[Verse 2]
After all these images of pain have cut right through you
I will kiss every scar, and weep you are not alone
Then I'll show you that place in my chest where my heart still tries to beat, it sets us apart

[Chorus]
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night, every evening that I die

There's a lightning storm each and every night
Crashing inside you like motorbikes
We toss and turn, sleep so loud
Grind the teeth in our empty mouths
Our empty...

[Verse 1]
There's a forest fire burning bright
Spreading quickly towards our last rites
Nowhere to run, pointless to hide
Just lay there and scream, pretending to try
Pretending...

[Chorus]
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and you burn

[Verse 2]
This impending doom is left deep inside
And it's haunting you each and every night
Like starving wolves counting sheep
We close our eyes, pretending to sleep
Descending...

Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home

As we burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and...

Streetlight Manifesto,Sick And Sad,neg,"9 ContributorsSick and Sad Lyrics[Chorus]
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet

[Verse 1]
Went to the corner of second and main
And there was someone there who mentioned that they hoped
That it would rain forever, forever
So they could drown in peace

(Well I) Went down to the hodskin p.l
But there was nobody to answer when I rang
The doorbell forever, forever
So now I'm sad all the time

[Chorus]
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet

[Verse 2]
Today was the day
But she threw it all away
And I could never understand
Cause she was never one to play by the rules of the game
Her and me we're so the same

You know I'm starting to believe it

I won't name who's to blame for the misery and pain
It's a shame all the same that we

We've got the fire tonight
We wanna fight but will that change anything?
Will it make it alright?

There's something wrong everywhere
And you're ashamed to admit it
But if it's not then you don't care
Well they will put you away

""We need your help. Pulling into the diner about now should be four top-secret agents. One of them is carrying a briefcase. Your mission is to obtain the disc from the briefcase.""

[Verse 1]
All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done

Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)
And now you want your money back (Your money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through

It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I had to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

[Bridge: Sting]
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say It

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I'll find
A real love

So I've tried my best and prayed to God he'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

Been around the world and high and low and still I never know

Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma (Woo!)
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me

I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in the maximum

40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all

Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat

Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the lowkey
With no regard for the law

Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample

It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?

It would be easier to take the wet from water
Or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us
And stop us from holding hands

Los Cadetes De Linares,Las Tres Tumbas,neg,"3 ContributorsLas Tres Tumbas LyricsSalieron de madrugada, se oía el canto de los gallos
Iban hacer dos jornadas al lomo de sus caballos
La fiesta se celebraba en el Rancho del Pitayo

Su padre les dio un consejo, cuando a partir se aprestaban
""Cuiden muy bien el pellejo, porque la vida se acaba""
En las palabras del viejo, los tres hermanos pensaban

Pedro le dice a Fabián, ""Dale un trago a José Luis
Que beba de ese mezcal pa' que se sienta feliz
Que ahorita nomás al llegar nos vamos a divertir""

Cuando arribaron al baile, a bailar se dirigieron
La muerte andaba en el aire, ellos no la presintieron
Como les dijo su padre, cuando del rancho salieron

Eran muchos los rivales, viejos rencores surgieron
Rondando tras los jacales abrieron todos el fuego
Así matan los cobardes cuando los acosa el miedo

Cuida el rancho y tres caballos como toda su fortuna

It is a long and winding road

From one who's seen the view
And dreamt of staying on the mountains high
And one who's cried like you
Wanting so much just to lay down and die
I offer this, we must remember this

Keep on looking ahead
Let you heart not forget

Sting,I Hung My Head,neg,"6 ContributorsI Hung My Head Lyrics[Verse 1]
Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 2]
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 3]
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head

I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead

Too little righteous indignation

Just cause you're kin I let it slide
Insults and judgments I've been blind
And it hard for you to deal out digs
With a calloused heart your words are quick

I'm sick and tired of throwing stones
Cause all that leaves is broken bones
And I won't shed no blood for you
Aww the cuts too deep the bruise too blue

I've wasted time and been hand fed
You can't take back the things you said
Too much time has gone and passed
Shattered lives and broken glass

The pain is felt behind my eyes
But you won't see me through my disguise
Can't change fate cause this is done
Aww too late to start the race is run

Now's the time to face the facts
This train done slid right off the tracks

There's thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fists

When He kicked 'em out of Eden
It wasn't for no reason
That He shed His blood
His return is very close
And so you better be believing that

In the void of the night

Descubro que hay sueos descubro miradas
Que enfran mi piel
Veo del mundo lo bello y lo cruel
Hay palabras que rompen mi hiel
Pero donde existe el dolor
Siempre hay una semilla de amor

Amor en silencio
Es vivir un momento a tiempo
Amor en silencio
Es un beso amar o dar perdn sin explicar
Solo un alma desnuda esa dicha puede lograr

Es andar a favor del viento

Es ganar en la vida el amor con voluntad

Every man for himself, can be difficult, mythical
Typical, critical, pitiful, beautiful, hypocritical, hypothetical
Alpha numerical the Darwinian way, obstacle course fittest survival
Unforgettable, unforgivable
Diabolical lies within the Bible, Unified Field Theory of Love
Ignoramus enlightened to his path and purpose
Creator, preserver, destroyer, curb server
Quantum mechanics converted from bow ties to Mormon
Also a paraplegic, whirling dervish
Pledge of Allegiance backwards
Rocket science nano technology
Awkward moments caught between a rock and a hard place
You're in a sticky situation, zero visibility
Late night radar emergencies passenger pilot
Typhoon, hurricane, broken components
Airstrips, stormy rain, military ship
Landing a plane to Malaysia, amnesia
Indonesia with a squeegee
You were trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents for a ticket to Fiji
With Saturday Night Fever without the Bee Gee's
All the doohickeys and thingamabob's of highly sensitive circuitry
Micro-engineering a blind man behind the wheel steering
Energy equaling matter or mass times the speed of light squared
Foreplay with the Catholic nun, makin' a hoe into a housewife
Making a crack head drop the pipe
Looking at Luke's peep show fully dressed
With a number of angels dancing on a nuclear warhead
Everyone on Earth chanting 'Om...'
Taking bong hits, holding hands, alone
At the same time finding a truly righteous queen in a strip club
Playing patty cakes with heartless thugs
Getting the Fellowship to rehearse for a show
We do reverse to a flow and do a motherfucking overdub

And race the cars, take the negative devil gene out of man
And erase the wars with a straight jacket and a crooked face
And a broken stick shifter, a ceremony for audio-body of

That You shine on
The darkness all around us
It all just disappears
You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near
Whoa
Whoa

You and me we used to be
Lovers torn and lost along the way
Until Heaven came and rescued me
I found grace right in front of me
This is love

That You shine on
The darkness all around us
It all just disappears
You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near

Cuz You never look away

The darkness all around us
It all just disappears
And You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near

Brandon Heath,Love Never Fails,pos,"4 ContributorsLove Never Fails Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is not proud
Love does not boast
Love after all
Matters the most
Love does not run
Love does not hide
Love does not keep
Locked inside
Love is the river that flows through

[Refrain]
And love never fails you

[Verse 2]
Love will sustain
Love will provide
Love will not cease
At the end of time
Love will protect
Love always hopes
Love still believes
When you don't
Love is the arms that are holding you

[Refrain]
Love never fails you

When my heart won't make a sound
When I can't turn back around
When the sky is falling down
Nothing is greater than this
Greater than this

[Verse 3]
'Cause love is right here
Love is alive
Love is the way
The truth, the life
Love is the river than flows through
Love is the arms that are holding you
And love is the place you will fly to

[Refrain]
Love never fails you1Embed"
Above The Golden State,I'll Love You So,pos,"2 ContributorsI’ll Love You So Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel the sun, it's returned again
To chase the cold far away
I'm not alone to fight the world I'm in
You gave me hope for better days

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was searching for a friend like no other
I never thought You'd come my way

[Chorus]
Everything I give to You
I'll love You so
Everything I say or do
I'll love You so

[Verse 2]
Look where we've come, how could I ever forget
Before Your love my heart was dead?
I was afraid that my sun would set
But You stayed around to lift my head

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was living my whole life undercover
I never dreamed I'd see Your face

Mark Schultz,Love Has Come,pos,"2 ContributorsLove Has Come LyricsWell, I know this life is filled with sorrow
And there are days when the pain just lasts and lasts
But I know there will come a day
When all our tears are washed away with a break in the clouds
His glory coming down and in that moment

Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, everyone will see
That God is love and love has come for us all

For anybody who has ever lost a loved one
And you feel like you had to let go too soon
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But don't you know it's just a matter of time 'til the tears are gonna end
You'll see him once again and in that moment

Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, everyone will see
That God is love and love has come for us all

Oh, and on that day we will stand amazed
At our savior, God and king
Just to see the face of amazing grace
As our hearts rise up and sing

And I believe in a hope that carries on

Would you be amazed by all of my abilities

Much if I didn't have love

Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?

In the morning when the day is new?

Hold each other close the whole night through

I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

Then I hung around 'til you said I do

And in the night, we'll wish this never ends

This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?

The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to Glory

There are whispers between the screams
That this deed can be done
Even sinners must dream
And I can be the one to make the Devil cry

I can win this game
If all things come together
I know this sounds quite strange
I won't be smart, just clever

It's the law on the other side
Just the kill lets you run
And how many have tried?
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry

At last my time has come
I must not give him pleasure
I can be the one
One chance or burn forever

So I told him about my pain
And the life I've been through
He just smiled and the laughter came
Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil cried

Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating
We were the first band to vomit in the bar
And find the distance to the stage too far
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive

[Verse 2]
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead, they say

Oh, I guess they'll never know

Tell them all it, please tell them it isn't fair

I hope and I'll pray that maybe someday
You'll be back (You'll be back), in my arms (in my arms)

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Please lord now forgive me
Even though I don't deserve
I never was too good in life
The devil's all I serve
My woman she done left me
I told twice to go
The first time she ignored me
But then I threw her on the floor

So down low better slow down lord

And if you don't pray for me now
Nobody ever will

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Now I'm in the graveyard
It's darkness all around
Voices floating through the air speaking with no sound
You were your father's son
But you left him far beyond
Beyond the reach of mercy
In the darkness of the sun

Los Tigres Del Norte,Jose Perez Leon,neg,"1 ContributorJosé Pérez León LyricsÉl era un hombre de campo, oriundo de Nuevo León
Tenía apenas diecinueve años, su nombre...
José Pérez León

Tenía un primo lejano que de mojado se fue
Al poco tiempo le envió un telegrama diciendo: ""Ven pronto, José""
Pues un trabajo le habían encontrando piscando algodón como él

Y se fue, y se fue ahogando en llanto en el adiós con su mujer
Se fue, sin saber que de ese viaje ya jamás iba a volver
Pobre José

Cuando llegó a la frontera con Willy se entrevistó
Era el pollero más afamado y astuto de la región
Le dijo: ""Pepe, hoy estás de suerte, mañana te cruzo yo""

La madrugada de un viernes, en una vieja estación
Veinte inocentes pagaban su cuota, entre ellos José Pérez León
Y sin dudarlo a todos metieron en el interior de un vagón

El tren cruzó al otro lado casi siete horas después
Fue cuando el aire empezó a terminarse y ya nada pudieron hacer
Nadie escuchó aquellos gritos de auxilio y la puerta no quiso ceder
Uno por uno se fueron cayendo y así, falleció el buen José

Y se fue, y se fue a cruzar el cielo con sus ansias de crecer
Se fue, sin saber que ya su esposa un hijo suyo iba a tener
Pobre José

Sidewalk Prophets,You Can Have Me,pos,"3 ContributorsYou Can Have Me LyricsIf I saw You on the street
And You said come and follow me
But I had to give up everything
All I once held dear and all of my dreams

Would I love You enough to let go
Or would my love run dry
When You asked for my life

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me

If You’re all You claim to be
Then I’m not losing anything
So I will crawl upon my knees
Just to know the joy of suffering

I will love You enough to let go
Lord, I give you my life
I give you my life

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
You might also likeI want to be where You are
I’m running into Your arms
And I will never look back
So Jesus, here is my heart

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
My Father, my love
You can have meEmbed"
Josh Wilson,Before The Morning,neg,"3 ContributorsBefore The Morning Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you wonder why you have to
Feel the things that hurt you?
If there's a God who loves you
Where is He now?
Or maybe there are things you can't see
And all those things are happening
To bring a better ending
Someday, somehow you'll see, you'll see

[Chorus]
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still have a reason to sing?
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming
So hold on, you gotta wait for the light
Press on and just fight the good fight
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It's just the dark before the morning

[Verse 2]
My friend, you know how this all ends
And you know where you're going
You just don't know how you'll get there
So say a prayer
And hold on
'Cause there's good for those who love God
But life is not a snapshot
It might take a little time, but you'll see the bigger picture

Press on and just fight the good fight

[Bridge]
Once you feel the weight of glory
All your pain will fade to memory
Once you feel the weight of glory
All your pain will fade to memory
Memory, memory, yeah
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still got a reason to sing?
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming

[Chorus]
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still got a reason to sing?
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming
Come on, you gotta wait for the light
Press on and just fight the good fight
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It's just the hurt before the healing
Oh, the pain that you've been feeling
It's just the dark before the morning

I felt it first when I was younger
A strange connection to the light
I tried to satisfy the hunger
I never got it right
I never got it right
So I climbed a mountain and l built an altar
Looked out as far as I could see
And every day I'm getting older
I'm runnin' outta dreams
I'm runnin' outta dreams

But your love, your love
The only the thing that matters is your love
Your love is all I have to give
Your love is enough to light up the darkness
It's your love, your love
All I ever needed is your love

Sin que algo conspire en mi contra

Jeremias,Hay Un Amor Afuera,neg,"1 ContributorHay un amor afuera LyricsCon un llanto empieza el baile
De la vida sin que alguien
Te explique como es

En un mundo al revez
Donde lo unico seguro
Siempre es un tal vez

Anda sin avanzar
Guardando de a poquito
El tiempo en el ayer

Remando río arriba
Cada noche, cada día
Sabiendo que

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir

Pero la luna llena
Que una noche desempeña
En recordar

Que hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir
Cada cual tiene un boleto
Que nos lleva
Lejos de la soledad

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena

A veces la nombro por casualidad
Y es que aún la recuerdo
Y es que aún llevo dentro su forma de amar

Una razón para ti
Me pides motivos y una explicación
Para no desterrarla ahora y para siempre de mi corazón

Yo soy así y seguiré vagando errante por tu piel
Yo no podré dar todo de mí mientras no olvide a esa mujer

Y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos
Hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión
En el que esta obsesión está apartándome de ti
Y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos
Y sigo sin saber por qué razón sigue ella en mi interior
Y en nuestro punto de inflexión
Y sigo esclavo de sus besos

No hay quien controle el amor
De hecho te quiero como a nadie a más
Pero a veces es ella la que me derrumba mi seguridad

Yo soy así y seguiré vagando errante por tu piel

Is it just me or is everyone, hiding out between the lights
Where will we be when we've come undone? Just a simple meeting of the minds

[Chorus]
Singing we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Your desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire

Underneath your stars
There's a million lies burning brightly just like fireflies

It's cold and heaven surround you from every direction
Cause there's someone behind every hand that you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on and tomorrow has become today, become today

All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
At any time my little world seems blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be

There's so much I wanna say

It would be like the sky that's never sunny
It would be like the bee that can't make honey
Or maybe like the fallen snow that never melts
Like always hearing of your touch but never felt
It's like the vase that holds no flowers

Never wanna wake without You
I never wanna part with life abundantly
Never take a chance without You
'Cause I'll never do my best without You
I never wanna leave this life abundantly
Hallelujah

It would be like the game that has no winner
Like knowing love's behind the door you cannot enter
Like knowing joy's in the morning that never comes
(Kinda like) What life would be if God didn't send His son
It's kinda like a heart with no love flowing through it

Telling me lies saying things that will keep me from leaving
Be a man not a boy running from the truth
You're always

You never come home
And when we have a fight
Cause you're doing me wrong
Still I can't leave
You're leaving me wondering

Something that's unbelievable
We been building on the slow but to see it come together
It's like a dream's achievable

We had bumps along the way, quite a few surprises
But we held fast, dealt with all the compromises
Put our pride aside how we sacrifice so long
For something we could call our own

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

I used to think of all the things we've overcome
As just our history
But now I know that all the things we built together
Will be our legacy

The world will know that we were here
Our intent to stay sincere, our purpose and hearts were clear
Our babies will have babies of their own
And our love will live on for generations to come

See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you

I don't know how you can stand next to me
You you talk like a noose
And only confuse my perplexity
Now that I'm so sad and not quite right
I could dance all night
I could dance all night

Shake your rattle-snake skin
And become a part of society
Wait on down the highway
To see how far I'll come a-run a-run
Run running
All that we had salvaged from the fire
Was a waste of time
(But) what a waste of time

Should I trust all the rust that's on TV
I guess with some distaste I disagree
With quite a fashionable dispassion for
The dispossessed under-stressed
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
And I don't care if you don't like it
Or just don't see

Now that we fattened the cow
And set out to plow unknown enemies
""Wow!"" shouts the startled crowd
""How now did you see what I did see?""
The ravaged cabbage drifts on dark red skies
And it looks so nice
Gee it looks so nice

A heavy burden to carry the bare soiled slate

Can't blame them take a look
Can't name 'em cause they shook

Fuck around with B'more
Make you look like you're white in a Harlem shaking contest
I harness the fondest crooks of phonics
Fuck grammar, ill-mannered
Don't start with Spank

Like nothing much, just your average such and such

Against Me!,I Was A Teenage Anarchist,neg,"14 ContributorsI Was a Teenage Anarchist Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was a teenage anarchist
Looking for a revolution
I had the style, I had the ambition
Read all the authors, I knew the right slogans
There was no war but the class war
I was ready to set the world on fire
I was a teenage anarchist
Looking for a revolution

[Chorus]
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

[Verse 2]
I was a teenage anarchist
But the politics were too convenient
In the depths of their humanity
All I saw was bloodless ideology
With freedom as the doctrine
Guess who was the new authority?

And I live to the south of town
I work my window, watching the women
Go round and round

Some people come here for love
Some people come for fantasy
When two in the morning comes around
My baby comes around for me

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day, we'll walk in the sun

I'm taking tickets
Watching the men always looking down
Sometimes I feel like an animal
In the zoo, staring out

No one looks me in the eye
They save it for the girls inside
I don't much care what they see
I know she saves it all for me

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one

Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
'Cause I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

You showed me how, how to leave myself behind
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
'Til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love
How to open up and drink in all that white love
Pouring down from the heaven

I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain

You've been portrayed a thousand different ways
But my heart can see you better than my eyes
'Cause it's love that paints the portrait of your life

You look more like love everyday

I've read your words in the pages of your life
And I've imagined what you were like
I may not know the shape of your face
But I can feel your heart changing mine
And your love still proves you're alive

You are the face that changed the whole world
No one too lost for you to love
No one too low for you to serve
So give us the grace to change the world
No one too lost for me to love
No one too low for me to serve

Is a wild and precious thing
It don't grow on old magnolias
Or only blossom in the spring

No, the glory of true love

Always will look good on you

Touch the moon and stars above
But Old Faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love

Long before I met you, darlin'

I could have my lunch in London
And my dinner in St. Paul

Where the governor calls me ""Gov""

[Chorus]

Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean (Uh)
With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killa hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

[Chorus]
These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (From my heart flow)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way (There's no other way)

These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (Yeah)
(I love you) I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you (I love you)
There's no other way (There's no other way)
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Bridge]
I'm gettin' off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes (Love you, love you)
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa
[Pre-Chorus]
(Whoa) Tryna find the magic
(Whoa) Tryna write a classic (Uh, yeah)
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own (These words are my own)

Akon,Don't Matter,neg,"51 ContributorsDon’t Matter Lyrics[Intro]
(Konvict, Konvict, Konvict)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight, oh, yes, we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (Right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)

[Verse 1]
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel I'm hopin' and prayin'
Things between us gon' get better
Men steady comin' after you
Women steady comin' after me
Seems like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Tellin' you all those lies
Just to get on yo' side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
Just know that I try to always apologize
But I'ma have you first, always in my heart to keep you satisfied

Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no

Fight for our right to love, yeah (Right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)

[Verse 2]
Got every right to wanna leave
Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no mo'
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
'Cause the way I've been actin' lately has been off the wall
Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you, baby

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight, oh, yes, we gon' fight (We gon' fight)

You can give me money, diamonds and pearls
But you can't buy my love with all the money in the world

[Chorus]
You can't buy my love
No, you can't buy my love
For no money in the world
You can't buy my love

Baby, I'm so glad
'Cause you done lost

Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone
Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone
Motherless children have a hard time
There's all that weeping and all that crying
Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone

[Verse 2]
Father will do the best he can when the mother is gone
Father will do the best he can when the mother is gone
Father will do the best he can
But there's so many things he just don't understand
Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone

[Verse 3]
People say a sister will do when the mother is gone
People say a sister will do when the mother is gone
People say a sister will do
But she'll get married, turn her back on you
Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone

[Verse 4]
Friends will treat you like your mother will when your mother is gone
Friends will treat you like your mother will when your mother is gone
Friends will tell you what to do
Then they'll turn their back on you

Well, the look on the cake, it ain't
It ain't always the taste
My ex-girl she had such
Such a beautiful face
I wanted love
But not for myself
But for the girl so she could
So she could love herself

[Chorus]
Oh, my next girl
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I'll never do it again
Oh, my next girl
She'll be nothing like my ex-girl
It was a painful dance
Now I got a second chance, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, her beautiful face and her
And her wicked way
And I am paying for her beautiful face
Every day
All that work over
Over so much time, if I
If I think too hard
I might lose my mind

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

[Pre-Chorus]
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found

The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe (Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do

Neil Young,Sign Of Love,pos,"3 ContributorsSign of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
When we go for a little walk
Out on the land
When we're just walking and holding hands

You can take it as a sign of love
When the winds of fate
Keep blowing and we both understand

[Chorus]
Sign of love
It's a sign of love
Sign of love[X2]

[Verse 2]
When we both have silver hair
And a little less time
But there still are roses on the vine

You can take it as a sign of love
When I look at you
When I'm looking at you for a long, long time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When I first saw you
You were just a girl
And I was a man
While the music played
I watched you dance

Vision of the sibyl has foretold
Armies gather on the battle plain
All will fall and Earth will die in flame

Here on the battle plain
We will die in flame

In falcon's feathers soaring overhead
Choosing warriors among the dead
Twilight written in the runes of crones
Freya weeps upon her golden throne

Upon her golden throne
We wait for her alone
Call us unto your hall
Take us into your thrall
The battle rages, but they fight in vain

Hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
And you said, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me

If you fall, I will catch you

I laid there feeling sorry for myself
In a bed of Kleenex
Stuffing chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend
Cussing my ex

He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinking I can't get over him

Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love

Got half a mind
To spend my whole pay check
On one of those dresses
The strapless black ones
That are so famous
For teaching lessons

To no surprise, it was my landlord
He notified me I was late with the rent
What do you do with your last dollar spent?

You got trouble

I called up my baby for a little advice
'Cause my sugar baby always treats me so nice
I had a funny feelin' he was not alone
When I heard another voice whisper ""hang up the phone""

Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind
There never any trouble for me to find
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)

I went to my boss
Said, ""I need a little time
To work on this poor old broken heart of mine.""

Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand

And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart

And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

That one day daddy's gonna find out she's in love
With a nigga from the streets
Oh how he would lose it then but she's still here with me

And one day he'll understand
And he'll see me as a person and not just a black man

Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Kept me as a prisoner in my home
Ground through my door when I was all alone
Scowled down on me laughed with the Sun
As he hid himself from darkness from everyone

The sky sometimes, so unkind, first he rains and then he shines
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
I will love you 'til the sky above you, shatters over you and me
And lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la

The sky today was brilliant and blue
Brightened up the walkway to my door
Brought you as a sunbeam on my floor
Beamed you down on me from the other side
Brought you up to me across the ocean wide

The sky sometimes so unkind then again he’s my best friend
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
I will love you 'til the sky above you, shatters over you and me

Sin tenerles compasión vilmente los torturaron
Y ya muertos, con un carro por encima les pasaron
En la colonia El Palmito, la ciudad fue Culiacán
Andaban Francisco López, también Francisco Beltrán
Ellos no se imaginaban que los iban a matar
Francisco López tenía unas cuentas atrasadas
Había matado derecho al que le robó a su amada
Pero Francisco Beltrán no tenía culpa de nada
Otro día los encontraron al amanecer el día
Tenían las tripas de fuera y un perro se las comía
Unos momentos después, llegaba la policía
Con la banda sinaloense los fueron a sepultar
Y dos madresitas lloran sin poderse consolar
Por sus hijos adorados que ahorita en el cielo están
Ya con esta me despido, y les digo en mi cantar
Que las malas compañías nada bueno han de dejar
Lo digo por el corrido, no se les vaya a olvidarYou might also likeEmbed"

And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed

I don't know what you're doin'
And I don't know where you are
But I look up at that great big sky
And I hope you're wishin' on that same
Bright star

I wonder, I pray

(Chorus:)
And I sleep alone
I cry alone
And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please, come home soon
(Come home soon)

I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny 'round my neck
Pressed to my heart

Garth Brooks,Standing Outside The Fire,neg,"10 ContributorsStanding Outside the Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned

[Verse 2]
We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned

[Pre-Chorus]
But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire

[Verse 3]
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

[Verse 4]
We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all

Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire

Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

[Bridge]
There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire

[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire

Lee Ann Womack,I May Hate Myself In The Morning,neg,"6 ContributorsI May Hate Myself in the Morning LyricsAin't it just like one of us
To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks
And say how you been, I've been wondering if
Maybe you've been thinkin about me
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Everyone's known someone that they
Just can't help but want
Even though we just can't make it work out
The want to, lingers on
So once again, we wind up in each other's arms
Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad
I guess that's what it is all lonely
Late night calls like this, that we try to find
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I may hate msyelf in the morning

Rattling between the frame and the sill

Lower the hood hung of his lament
Dash him down on cold cement

Ahogandome una vez mas
Te quema el aire en la piel
Y vivir me da igual

Me duele tanto saber
Me duele solo pensar
Que moriremos asi y de igual forma te vas
Tus palabras me pueden mentir
Tu mirada jamas

Contra viento y marea
Y tal vez contra el mundo
Luchare con quien sea
Sin dudar un segundo
Con todo el corazon
A matar o morir
Contra viento y marea por estar junto a ti

Llevo un silencio que da
La sensacion de gritar

Tengo la mente en tu voz
Que pide nunca olvidar
Tus palabras me pueden mentir

There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart

Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out and to your surprise
And to mine, I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes to a single yellow rose

And for years to come, you were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk and share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every rare occasion
And for no good reason too
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you

Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go?

Are you sending your new love

You loved me at one time

And I'll try to pretend that you love me again

You'll know when the moment is right
When I was broken in two it was all because of you
But baby I need you tonight

Oh no

You walk away and left me out of control

The Statler Brothers,Bed Of Roses,pos,"16 ContributorsBed of Rose’s Lyrics[Verse 1]
She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own, I never had a home
And an eighteen-year-old boy has got to eat

[Verse 2]
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose

[Chorus]
This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

[Verse 3]
She was a handsome woman just thirty-five
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do

[Verse 4]
And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of, I suppose
But she died knowing that I really loved her
Of life's bramble bush I picked a rose

Yes, you know I'm on the road once again it seems
All that's left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you

And how I wish that love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have 'cause I've got so much to give
But you know I feel so sad down inside my heart
That the dollar signs should be keeping us apart
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you

And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent, so I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this traveling life, well, it's the only life I know

Just to get wet on purpose

Just to feel worse

I couldn't care less

In the past there were arguments for and against casual sex. Then it became a question of morality. These days it can be a question of life or death. It's as simple as that. And this song is not about casual sex

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
There's things that you guess
And a'things a'that you know
There's boys you can trust
And a'girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies (Yeah)

[Verso 1]
Es otro día más sin verte y sin embargo estoy sonriendo
Es por el dulce néctar que me ofrecieron esos momentos
Son 5:09 A.M.: Antes de Matarte
Esa fue la hora que escogí para por fin olvidarte
Odiarte fue imposible cuando por dentro venció el miedo
Esa es la forma más ridícula de decir que te quiero
Sacar de mi vida se ha convertido en un reto
Porque usted está aquí como un parásito que alimento
Lo siento, pero es momento de seguir vivo
Entregándome a mis letras, intentando llenar vacíos
Y no hablo el de mi cama ni mis páginas rotas
Que el único vacío fue el tuyo, pero ya no importa
Aunque se acorta la distancia, el olvido está al acecho
Ofreciendo sanar la herida que se encuentra en nuestros pechos
No lo pienses demasiado, acepta la oportunidad
Porque el amor jamás se olvida besándote en cualquier bar

[Puente]
Eh

[Verso 2]
Tú tira a matar, feliz estoy porque me mates
Porque prefiero tu frialdad a que tengas otro amante
Por ti perdí dignidad y otras cosas importantes
Aunque la culpa fue tuya por amar a este Don Nadie
¿Alguien en este momento te insiste que no estés triste
Mientras te promete algo mejor de lo que tuviste?
Recházalo, tú sabes bien cómo está bussiness
Los hombres sólo son cuervos disfrazándose de cisnes
¿Ellos te hablan con malicia? Yo te hablé por mis heridas
Prometimos estar juntos, otra promesa perdida
No te di todo el amor, pero, a decir verdad
Te di algo mucho más valioso que se llamó ""libertad""
Una hermosa dualidad, perfecta dicotomía
Devastado por frialdad y absurda monotonía
No tuve la habilidad de demostrar lo que sentía
Y con amabilidad pedí que te fueras de mi vida

No quedaba otra salida; si quieres, dime un cobarde
Por decir lo que debía siendo demasiado tarde
No sabía lo que tenía, no me arrepiento de eso
Porque si me daba cuenta, seguiría viviendo preso
No me perdones, supongo que este es el precio
De matar lo más hermoso tirándolo de mi trapecio
Confío que el tiempo hará más soportable tu recuerdo
Y hablando del tiempo, es hora de caminar un momento
Sentado y relajado, fumándome otro cigarro
Recordando todas las cosas que hemos pasado
Y preguntando ¿Qué causará en mí tantos problemas?
Tu ausencia debe serlo pues le dolería a cualquiera
Cuánta razón, wey, sólo olvidamos la variable
Que el tiempo se vuelve inútil si se le regala a alguien
Unos pierden la vida hablando de lo que tenían
Yo desperdicié mi tiempo hablando a quien no conocía
Y sentí que esto no tenía remedio
Te vi y me di cuenta que esto iba en serio
Debí asesinarte cuando podía
Temí que te quedaras matándome a sangre fría
Hoy en día me ven esperando el mismo tren
Me observan como un Adán que ha perdido el Edén, no sé
La respuesta que doy cuando por ti me preguntan
Porque lo mismo me pregunto cuando observo tu tumba
No se trata de segundas ni de terceras partes
Se trata de recordar a la mujer que fuiste antes
Se trata de describir tu persona en su conjunto
Y responderme ¿Por qué no funciona el ""siempre juntos""?
Punto final, ya esta caja se cierra
Con la intención de que la abras y destruyas la Tierra, Pandora
Hey, no entiendo por qué lloras
Si lo que destruimos, lo reconstruirán otras personas
Y así funciona, aunque sigo sin entender
Tu concepto sobre amar no me pudo enardecer
""El amor nunca fue amor cuando se deja vencer""
Entonces nunca se ha amado porque todos pueden perder
Es otra noche más sin ti, sin embargo estoy sonriendo
¿Ves como desde la primera barra estoy mintiendo?

Tower Of Power,Give Me Your Love,pos,"1 ContributorTalamasca LyricsFrom that crazy night
I never forget my love
Before he pile of logs
She stood like unconscious ghost
A last scream from the stake
Her mother was burnt, she heard
The crowd...

I took her far away, over the seas
Far from the fears I thought
But the demon followed
Lover of the witches and their souls

And now I had to see her there
On the place she's always feared
The flames waited for her blood
'Cause of her demon's fault...

""I've never hurt you, I've never been
The witch you want to burn
The witch you kill!
Oh, Lasher come
Show me your love
Give me a vengence,a great last fight
Show me your power
To show them mine
Destroy these liars, my untrue sons
The killer crowd...""
And the storm came, the wind blew blood
Walls fell down on human's flood
Souls got burnt in the flashes of anger
My witch stepped in the tower of the temple

In their hearts, she saw all lies:
Her suffer made the demon awake...

Flowing out of her scarlet mouth

To take her body on the fameing logsEmbed"

Thousands where killed, cities where laid to waste
Merciless genocide, wiped out civilization
The land was reigned, by famine, war and plague

Since my gal and I ain't together, keeps raining all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere, stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

When she went away the blues walked in and they met me
If she stays away, that old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, everything I have is gone, stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

And I forget to do

That everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go
'Til I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

Que no tengo todo el día para seguir discutiendo

Y me harté de hacerme el mudo
Quítate el complejo de teniente
Que el amor sin libertad
Dura lo que un estornudo
Son iguales los defectos que hoy me tiras en la cara
Y al principio eran perfectos

Marty Robbins,Big Iron,neg,"67 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийBig Iron Lyrics[Verse 1]
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death
[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Getting lost by the guide
And I'm all worked up over nothing

All running out
Connect my body
Deep into the ground

Connect the Earth to the moon
And link our heavenly bodies
Not a moment too soon
Well you can fling open the windows
Or you can board 'em up

Or Christ’s humble cup
You think you'll find yourself out there
Out in the lion’s den
In some bloody battle
Over belief systems

Where you can't lose nothing
But nothing can be gained

Over the hallowed ground
Out on the circuit
Over the hallowed ground
Ending up in the same place
That we started out
Right back in the same place
Right back in the same place

How we take each other's love without thinking anymore

Their eyes can't hope to see the beauty that surrounds them

There's sap in the trees if you tap 'em
There's blood on the seas if you map 'em
Christian, if you see your papa, tell him I love him
He taught me to love in the wild and fight in the gym
He taught me the bottle gives birth to the cup
And you won't get hurt if you just keep your hands up
And stand tall like sycamores

Sycamore got to grow down to grow up
Young roots toil the soil like baby's first cup
And when they bend you in two
And say too green for the fire
When all you want to do is be a part of the fire
All you want to do is be the fire part of fire
Like sycamores

The reason for this wrath bestowed by flame beyond the sea
Tonight I've heard the cry and swear by all I've seen
That vengeance will one day be mine satisfaction will I breathe

Have you seen your who world build from ash to ashes return

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight
No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire, this is a firefight

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, ""Be afraid""
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction

Everywhere is war

First-class and second-class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes

Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued

And that ain't even cool to miss a few summers, shit
I'll take a bite out the onion like fuck it!
And won't cry

Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause

And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid
Baby, I'm just a man and
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry

And straight level vodka's the potion, makes me spill my emotion and
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Keep on coming with that gangsta music, Young Weezy got that motherfucking gangsta music
Yo so ride to to it y'all and vibe to it y'all, hey and

Billie Holiday,Nice Work If You Can Get It,pos,"7 ContributorsNice Work If You Can Get It LyricsThe man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if

We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Stare out at the auburn sky

To him, it's all the same
Calls all his customers by name

It's the kind that eats you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride

And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place

Yeah
Ya no te quiero
Estoy raro en este momento
Pero sabes que cuando me pongo raro siempre miento
No estoy contento, reiría si volvieras
Tómalo como una romántica tiradera
Es rara la primavera sin sentir tus intenciones
Es raro no pensarte, pero sacarte canciones
Amarte es un placer, pero odiarte son ocasiones
Y hay que reconocer que finges bien tus emociones
Si la tristeza hablara, si el miedo tuviera cara
Si el tiempo se para y la soledad me mirara
Si la cólera y el odio me abrazara
Si tus mentiras con mi cariño se reencontraran
Pero así te amaba, y cuando te miro ahora
Siento un mejor presente, si es que mi pasado llora
Pero hay algo más grande, que me enseñó tu cora'
Que cupido junta gente, pero jamás se enamora
Un rencor te maldice, mi alma me contradice
Dígale a mi karma, que mi ego no lo pise
Un error puede cambiar, depende como se utilice
Ya no importa, si tú eres el error que siempre quise
Tampoco fue en vano hacértelo desde temprano
Pasear, caminar de la mano
Ponerte celosa, pero obvio un celo sano
Por las que se acercan por Ator, y no por Adriano
¿Y por qué la mirada, la cara de preocupada?
Si estoy seguro que tú por mí no sientes nada
Ya no le fingas a tu almohada, con tu tonto episodio

Ann Hampton Callaway,What Is This Thing Called Love?,pos,"5 ContributorsThe Aeneid (book 4) Lyrics[1] But the queen, long since smitten with a grievous love-pang, feeds the wound with her lifeblood, and is wasted with fire unseen. Oft to her mind rushes back the hero’s valour, oft his glorious stock; his looks and words cling fast to her bosom, and longing withholds calm rest from her limbs.

[6] The morrow’s dawn was lighting the earth with the lamp of Phoebus, and had scattered from the sky the dewy shades, when, much distraught, she thus speaks to her sister, sharer of her heart: “Anna, my sister, what dreams thrill me with fears? Who is this stranger guest who ahs entered our home? How noble his mien! How brave in heart and feats of arms! I believe it well – nor is my confidence vain – that he is sprung from gods. It is fear that proves souls base-born. Alas! by what fates is he vexed! What wars, long endured, did he recount! Were the purpose not planted in my mind, fixed and immovable, to ally myself with none in bond of wedlock, since my first love, turning traitor, cheated me by death; were I not tired of the bridal bed and torch, to this one fault, perhaps, I might have yielded! Anna – for I will own it – since the death of my hapless lord Sychaeus, and the shattering of our home by a brother’s murder, he alone has swayed my will and overthrown my tottering soul. I feel again a spark of that former flame. But rather, I would pray, may earth yawn for me to its depths, or may the Almighty Father hurl me with his bolt to the shades – the pale shades and abysmal night in Erebus – before, Shame, I violate you or break your laws! He who first linked me to himself has taken away my heart; may he keep it with him, and guard it in the grave!” So saying, she filled her breast with upwelling tears.

[31] Anna replies: “O you who are dearer to your sister than the light, are you, lonely and sad, going to pine away all your youth long, and know not sweet children or love’s rewards? Do you think that dust or buried shades give heed to that? Grant that until now no wooers moved your sorrow, not in Libya, not before then in Tyre; that Iarbas was slighted, and other lords whom the African land, rich in triumphs, rears; will you wrestle also with a love that pleases? And does it not come to your mind whose lands you have settled in? On this side Gaetulian cities, a race invincible in war, unbridled Numidians, and the unfriendly Syrtis hem you in; on that side lies a tract barren with drought, and Barcaeans, raging far and wide. Why speak of the wars rising from Tyre, your brother’s threats . . . ? I certainly believe that it was with the gods’ favour and Juno’s aid that the Ilian ships held their course hither with the wind. What a city you will see rise here, my sister, what a realm, by reason of such a marriage! With Teucrian arms beside us, to what heights will Punic glory soar? Only ask favour of the gods and, with sacrifice duly offered, be lavish with your welcome, and weave pleas for delay, while at sea winter rages fiercely and Orion is stormy – while the ships are shattered, and the skies intractable!”

[54] With these words she fanned into flame the queen’s love-enkindled heart, put hope in her wavering mind, and loosed the bonds of shame. First they visit the shrines and sue for peace at every altar; duly they slay chosen sheep to Ceres the law-giver, to Phoebus and father Lyaeus, above all to Juno, guardian of the bonds of marriage. Dido herself, matchless in beauty, with cup in hand, pours libation midway between the horns of a white heifer, or in presence of the gods moves slowly to the rich altars, and day by day renews her gifts, then, gazing into the opened breasts of victims, consults the quivering entrails. Ah, the blind souls of seers! Of what avail are vows or shrines to one wild with love? All the while the flame devours her tender heartstrings, and deep in her breast lives the silent wound. Unhappy Dido burns, and through the city wanders in frenzy – even as a hind, smitten by an arrow, which, all unwary, amid the Cretan woods, a shepherd hunting with darts has pierced from afar, leaving in her the winged steel, unknowing: she in flight ranges the Dictaean woods and glades, but fast to her side clings the deadly shaft. Now through the city’s midst she leads Aeneas with her, and displays her Sidonian wealth and the city built; she begins to speak and stops with the word half-spoken. Now, as day wanes, she seeks that same banquet, again in her madness craves to hear the sorrows of Ilium and again hangs on the speaker’s lips. Then when all have gone their ways, and in turn the dim moon sinks her light, and the setting stars invite sleep, alone she mourns in the empty hall, and falls on the couch he has left. Though absent, each from each, she hears him, she sees him, or, captivated by his look of his father, she holds Ascanius on her lap, in case she may beguile a passion beyond all utterance. No longer rise the towers begun, no longer do the youth exercise in arms, or toil at havens or bulwarks for safety in war; the works are broken off and idle – great menacing walls and cranes that touch the sky.

[90] Soon as the loved wife of Jove saw that Dido was held in a passion so fatal, and that her good name was now no bar to her frenzy, the daughter of Saturn accosts Venus thus: “Splendid indeed is the praise and rich the spoils you win, you and your boy; mighty and glorious is the power divine, if one woman is subdued by the guile of two gods! Nay, it escapes me not how, in fear of our city, you have held in suspicion the homes of high Carthage. But what shall be the end? And what is the point of all this contest now? Why do we not rather strive for an enduring peace and a plighted wedlock? What you sought with all your heart you have; Dido is on fire with love and has drawn the madness through her veins. Let us then rule this people jointly with equal sovereignty; let her serve a Phrygian husband and yield her Tyrians to your power as dowry!”

[105] To her – for she knew that with feigned purpose she had spoken, to turn the empire from Italy to Libya’s shores – Venus thus began in reply: “Who so mad as to refuse such terms, or prefer to strive against you in war, as long as Fortune favour the fulfilment of your word? But the Fates send me adrift, uncertain whether Jupiter wills that there be one city for the Tyrians and the wanderers from Troy, or approves the blending of peoples and the league of union. You are his wife; it is lawful for you to try to persuade his heart with entreaty. Go on; I will follow!” Then queenly Juno thus replied: “With me shall rest that task. Now in what way the present purpose can be achieved, hearken and I will explain in brief. Aeneas and unhappy Dido plan to go hunting together in the forest, as soon as tomorrow’s sun shows his rising and with his rays unveils the world. On them, while the hunters run to and fro and gird the glades with nets, I will pour down from above a black rain mingled with hail, and wake the whole welkin with thunder. The company shall scatter and be veiled in gloom of night; to the same cave shall come Dido and the Trojan chief. I will be there and, if I can be sure of your good will, will link them in sure wedlock, sealing her for his own; this shall be their bridal!” Yielding to her suit, the Cytherean gave assent and smiled at the guile discovered.

[129] Meanwhile Dawn rose and left the ocean. When sunlight has burst forth, there issues from the gates a chosen band of youth; with meshed nets, toils, broad-pointed hunting spears, there stream forth Massylian horsemen and their strong, keen-scented hounds. As the queen lingers in her bower, the Punic princes await her at the doorway; her prancing steed stands brilliant in purple and gold, and proudly champs the foaming bit. At last she comes forth, attended by a mighty throng, and clad in a Sidonian robe with embroidered border. Her quiver is of gold, her tresses are knotted into gold, a buckle of gold clasps her purple cloak. With her pace a Phrygian train and joyous Iulus. Aeneas himself, goodly beyond all others, advances to join her and unites his band with hers. As when Apollo quits Lycia, his winter home, and the streams of Xanthus, to visit his mother’s Delos, and renews the dance, while mingling about his altars Cretans and Dryopes and painted Agathyrsians raise their voices – he himself treads the Cynthian ridges, and with soft foliage shapes and binds his flowing locks, braiding it with golden diadem; the shafts rattle on his shoulders: so no less lightly than he went Aeneas, such beauty shines forth from his noble face! When they came to the mountain heights and pathless lairs, wild goats dislodged from the rocky peaks ran down the ridges; in another part stags scurry across the open moors and amid clouds of dust mass their bands in flight, as they leave the hills behind. But in the midst of the valleys the young Ascanius glories in his fiery steed, galloping past now these, now those, and prays that amid the timorous herds a foaming boar may be granted to his vows or a tawny lion come down from the mountain.

[160] Meanwhile in the sky begins the turmoil of a wild uproar; rain follows, mingled with hail. The scattered Tyrian train and the Trojan youth, with the Dardan grandson of Venus, in their fear seek shelter here and there over the fields; torrents rush down from the heights. To the same cave come Dido and the Trojan chief. Primal Earth and nuptial Juno give the sign; fires flashed in Heaven, the witness to their bridal, and on the mountaintop screamed the Nymphs. That day the first of death, the first of calamity was cause. For no more is Dido swayed by fair show or fair fame, no more does she dream of a secret love: she calls it marriage and with that name veils her sin.

[173] At once Rumour runs through Libya’s great cities – Rumour the swiftest of all evils. Speed lends her strength, and she winds vigour as she goes; small at first through fear, soon she mounts up to heaven, and walks the ground with head hidden in the clouds. Mother Earth, provoked to anger against the gods, brought her forth last, they, say as sister to Coeus and Enceladus, swift of foot and fleet of wing, a monster awful and huge, who for the many feathers in her body has as many watchful eyes beneath – wondrous to tell – as many tongues, as many sounding mouths, as many pricked-up ears. By night, midway between heaven and earth, she flies through the gloom, screeching, and droops not her eyes in sweet sleep; by day she sits on guard on high rooftop or lofty turrets, and affrights great cities, clinging to the false and the wrong, yet heralding truth. Now exulting in manifold gossip, she filled the nations and sang alike of fact and falsehood, how Aeneas is come, one born of Trojan blood, to whom in marriage fair Dido deigns to join herself; now they while away the winter, all its length, in wanton ease together, heedless of their realms and enthralled by shameless passion. These tales the foul goddess spreads here and there upon the lips of men. Straightway to King Iarbas she bends her course, and with her words fires his spirit and heaps high his wrath.

[198] He, the son of Hammon by a ravished Garamantian Nymph, set up to Jupiter in his broad realms a hundred vast temples, a hundred altars, and had hallowed the wakeful fire, the eternal sentry of the gods. The ground was fat with the blood of beasts and the portals bloomed with varied garlands. Distraught in mind and fired with the bitter tale, they say, before the altars and amid the divine presences he often besought Jove in prayer with upturned hands: “Almighty Jupiter, to whom now the Moorish race, feasting on embroidered couches, pour a Lenaean offering, do you see these things? Is it vainly, father, that we shudder at you, when you hurl your thunderbolts? And do aimless fires amid the clouds terrify our souls and stir murmurs void of purpose? This woman who, straying in our bounds, set up a tiny city at a price, to whom we gave coastland to plough and terms of tenure, has spurned my offers of marriage, and welcomed Aeneas into her realm as lord. And now that Paris with his eunuch train, his chin and perfumed locks bound with a Lydian turban, grasps the spoil; while we bring offerings to your temples, yours forsooth, and cherish an idle story.”

[219] As with such words he pleaded, clasping the altars, the Almighty gave ear and turned his eyes on the royal city and the lovers forgetful of their nobler fame. Then thus to Mercury he speaks and gives this charge: “Go forth, my son, call the Zephyrs, glide on they wings, and speak to the Dardan chief, who now at Carthage is looking forward to Tyrian cities, unmindful of those granted him by the Fates; so carry down my words through the swift winds. Not such as this did his lovely mother promise him to us, nor for this twice rescue him from Grecian arms; but he it was who should rule Italy, a land teeming with empire and clamorous with war, hand on a race from Teucer’s noble blood, and bring all the world beneath his laws. If the glory of such a fortune fires him not and for his own fame’s sake he shoulders not the burden, does he, the father, grudge Ascanius the towers of Rome? What is his plan? In what hope does he tarry among a hostile people and pays no heed to Ausonia\s race and the Lavinian fields? Let him set sail; this is the sum; be this the message from me.”

[238] He ceased. The god made ready to obey his mighty father’s bidding, and first binds on his feet the golden shoes which carry him upborne on wings over seas or land, swift as the gale. Then he takes his wand; with this he calls pale ghosts from Orcus and sends others down to gloomy Tartaurs, gives or takes away sleep and unseals eyes in death; relying on this, he drives the winds and skims the stormy clouds. And now in flight he descries the peak and steep sides of toiling Atlas, who props heaven on his peak – Atlas, whose pine-wreathed head is ever girt with black clouds, and beaten with wind and rain; fallen snow mantles his shoulders while rivers plunge down the aged chin and his rough beard is stiff with ice. Here, poised on even wings, the Cyllenian first halted; hence with his whole frame he sped sheer down to the waves like a bird, which round the shores, round the fish-haunted cliffs, flies low near to the waters. Even thus between earth and sky flew Cyllene’s nursling to Libya’s sandy shore, and cut the winds, coming from his mother’s sire.

[259] As soon as with winged feet he reached the huts, he sees Aeneas founding towers and building new houses. And his sword was starred with yellow jasper, and a cloak hung from his shoulders ablaze with Tyrian purple – a gift that wealthy Dido had wrought, interweaving the web with thread of gold. At once he assails him: “Are you now laying the foundations of lofty Carthage, and building up a fair city, and all for a woman’s whim? Alas! With never a thought of your own realm and fate! The ruler of the gods himself, who sways heaven and earth with his power, sends me down to you from bright Olympus. He himself bids me bring this charge through the swift breezes: What are you planning? In what hope do you waste idle hours in Libyan lands? If the glory of such a fortune does not stir you, and for your own fame’s sake you do not shoulder the burden, have regard from growing Ascanius, the promise of Iulus your heir, to whom the kingdom of Italy and the Roman land are due.” Such words the Cyllenian spoke, and while yet speaking left the sight of men and far away from their eyes vanished into thin air.
[279] But in truth Aeneas, aghast at he sight, was struck dumb; his hair stood up in terror and the voice choked in his throat. He burns to flee away and quit that pleasant land, awed by that warning and divine commandment. Ah, what to do? With what speech now dare he approach the frenzied queen? What opening words choose first? And as he casts his swift mind this way and that, takes it in different directions and considers every possibility, this, as he wavered, seemed the better counsel; he calls Mnestheus and Sergestus, bidding them make ready the fleet in silence, gather the crews to the shore, and order the armament, but hide the cause of his altered plans. He meanwhile, since gracious Dido knows nothing, nor expects the breaking of so strong a love, will essay an approach and seek the happiest season for speech, the plan auspicious for his purpose. At once all gladly obey his command and do his bidding.

[296] But the queen – who may deceive a lover? – divined his guile, and early caught news of the coming stir, fearful even when all was safe. The same heartless Rumour brought her the maddening news that they are arming the fleet and making ready for sailing. Helpless in mind she rages, and all aflame raves through the city, like some Thyiad startled by the shaken emblems, when she has heard the Bacchic cry: the biennial revels fire her and at night Cithaeron summons her with its din. At length she thus accosts Aeneas first:

[305] “’False one! Did you really hope to cloak so foul a crime, and to steal from my land in silence? Does neither our love restrain you, nor the pledge once given, nor the doom of a cruel death for Dido? Even in the winter season do you actually hasten to labour at your fleet, and to journey over the sea in the midst of northern gales, heartless one? What! If you were not in quest of alien lands and homes unknown, were ancient Troy yet standing, would Troy be sought by your ships over stormy seas? Is it from me you are fleeing? By these tears and your right hand, I pray you – since nothing else, alas, have I left myself – by the marriage that is ours, by the nuptial rites begun, if ever I deserved well of you, or if anything of mine has been sweet in your sight, pity a falling house, and if yet there be any room for prayers, put away, I pray, this purpose. Because of you the Libyan tribes and Numidian chiefs hate me, the Tyrians are my foes; because of you I have also lost my honour and that former fame by which alone I was winning a title to the stars. To whose mercy do you leave me on the point of death, guest – since that alone is left from the name of husband? Why do I linger? Is it till Pygmalion, my brother, overthrow this city, or the Gaetulian Iarbas lead me captive? At least, if before your flight a child of yours had been born to me, if in my hall a baby Aeneas were playing, whose face, in spite of all, would bring back yours, I should not think myself utterly vanquished and forlorn.”

[331] She ceased: he by Jove’s command held his eyes steadfast and with a struggle smothered the pain deep within his heart. At last he briefly replies: “I will never deny, Queen, that you have deserved of me the utmost you can set forth in speech, nor shall my memory of Elissa be bitter, while I have memory of myself, and while breath governs these limbs. For my conduct few words will I say. I did not hope – think not that – to veil my flight in stealth. I never held out a bridegroom’s torch or entered such a compact. Had destiny permitted me to shape my life after my own pleasure and order my sorrows at my own will, my first care would be the city of Troy and the sweet relics of my king. Priam’s high house would still abide and my own hand would have set up a revived Pergamus for the vanquished. But now of great Italy has Grynean Apollo bidden me lay hold, of Italy the Lycian oracles. There is my love, there my country! If the towers of Carthage and the sight of Libyan city charm you, a Phoenician, why, pray, grudge the Trojans their settling on Ausonian land? We, too, have the right to seek a foreign realm. Each time the night with dewy shades veils the earth, each time the starry fires arise, in my dreams my father Anchises’ troubled ghost brings me warning and terror; the thought of young Ascanius comes to me and the wrong done to one so dear, whom I am cheating of a Hesperian kingdom and predestined lands. Now, too, the messenger of the gods sent from Jove himself – I sear by both our lives – has borne his command down through the swift breezes; my own eyes saw the god in the clear light of day come within our walls and these ears drank in his words. Cease to inflame yourself and me with your complaints. It is not by my wish that I make for Italy . . . “

[362] As thus he spoke, all the while she gazes on him askance, turning her eyes to and fro, and with silent glances scans the whole man; then thus, inflamed, cries out: “False one, no goddess was your mother, nor was Dardanus the founder of your line, but rugged Caucasus on his flinty rocks begot you, and Hyrcanian tigresses suckled you. For why hide my feelings? For what greater wrongs do I hold myself back? Did he sigh while I wept? Did he turn on me a glance? Did he yield and shed tears or pity her who loved him? What shall I say first? What next? Now, neither mighty Juno nor the Saturnian sire looks on these things with righteous eyes! Nowhere is faith secure. I welcomed him, a castaway on the shore, a beggar, and madly gave him a share of my throne; his lost fleet I rescued, his crews I saved from death. Alas! I am whirled on the fires of frenzy. Now prophetic Apollo, now the Lycian oracles, now the messenger of the gods sent from Jove himself, brings through the air this dread command. Truly, this is work for gods, this is care to vex their peace! I detain you not; I dispute not your words. Go, make for Italy with the winds; seek your kingdom over the waves. Yet I trust, if the righteous gods have any power, that on the rocks midway you will drain the cup of vengeance and often call on Dido’s name. Though far away, I will chase you with murky brands and, when chill death has severed soul and body, everywhere my shade shall haunt you. Relentless one, you will repay! I shall hear, and the tale will reach me in the depths of the world below!” So saying, she breaks off her speech midway and flees in anguish from the light, turning away, tearing herself from his sight, and leaving him in fear and much hesitance, and ready to say much. Her maids support her, carry her swooning form to her marble bower, and lay her on her bed.

[393] But loyal Aeneas, though longing to soothe and assuage her grief and by his words turn aside her sorrow, with many a sigh, his soul shaken by his mighty love, yet fulfils Heaven’s bidding and returns to the fleet. Then, indeed, the Teucrians fall to and all along the shore launch their tall ships. The keels, well-pitched, are set afloat; the sailors, eager for flight, bring from the woods leafy boughs for oars and logs unhewn . . . One could see them moving away and streaming forth from all the city. Even as when ants, mindful of winter, plunder a huge heap of corn and store it in their home; over the plain moves a black column, and through the grass they carry the spoil on a narrow track; some strain with their shoulders and heave on the huge grains, some close up the ranks and rebuke the delay; all the path is aglow with work. What feelings then were yours, Dido, at such a sight! or what sighs did you utter, viewing from the top of the fortress the beach aglow far and near, and seeing before your eyes the whole sea astir with loud cries! O relentless Love, to what do you not drive the heats of men. Once more she must needs break into tears, once more assail him with prayer, and humbly bow down her pride to love, lest she leave anything untried and go to death in vain.

[416] “Anna, you see the bustle all along the shore; from all sides they have gathered; already the canvas invites the breeze, and the joyous sailors have crowned the stern with garlands. If I have had strength to foresee this great sorrow, I shall also, sister, have strength to endure it. Yet this one service, Anna, do for me – for you alone that traitor made his friend, to you he confided even his secret thoughts, you alone will know the hour for easy access to him – go, sister, and humbly address our haughty foe. I never conspired with the Danaans at Aulis to root out the Trojan race; I never sent a fleet to Pergamus, nor tore up the ashes and disturbed the spirit of his father Anchises. Why does he refuse to admit my words to his stubborn ears? Whither does he hasten? This, the last boon, let him grant his poor lover: let him await an easy flight and favouring winds. No more do I plead for the old marriage tie which he forswore, nor that he give up fair Latium and resign his realm: for empty time I ask, for peace and reprieve for my frenzy, till fortune teach my vanquished soul to grieve. This last grace I crave – pity your sister – which, when he has granted it, I will repay with full interest in my death.”

[437] Such was her prayer and such the tearful pleas the unhappy sister bears again and again. But by no tearful pleas is he moved, nor in yielding mood does he pay heed to any words. Fate withstands and heaven seals his kindly, mortal ears. Even as when northern Alpine winds, blowing now hence, now thence, emulously strive to uproot an oak strong with the strength of years, there comes a roar, the trunk quivers and the high leafage thickly strews the ground, but the oak clings to the crag, and as far as it lifts its top to the airs of heaven, so far it strikes its roots down towards hell – even so with ceaseless appeals, from this side and from that, the hero is buffeted, and in his mighty heart feels agony: his mind stands steadfast; his tears fall without effect.

[450] Then, indeed, awed by her doom, luckless Dido prays for death; she is weary of gazing on the arch of heaven. And to make her more surely fulfil her purpose and leave the light, she saw, as she laid her gifts on the altars ablaze with incense – fearful to tell – the holy water darken and the outpoured wine change into loathsome gore. Of this sight she spoke to no one – not even her sister. Moreover, there was in the palace a marble chapel to her former lord, which she cherished in wondrous honour, wreathing it with snowy fleeces and festal foliage. Thence she heard, it seemed, sounds and speech as of her husband calling, whenever darkling night held the world; and alone on the housetops with ill-boding song the owl would oft complain, drawing out its lingering notes into a wail; and likewise many a saying of the seers of old terrifies her with fearful boding. In her sleep fierce Aeneas himself drives her in her frenzy; and ever she seems to be left lonely, ever ending, companionless, an endless way, and seeking her Tyrians in a land forlorn – even as raving Pentheus sees the Bacchants’ bands, and a double sun and two-fold Thebes rise to view; or as when Agamemnon’s son, Orestes, hounded by the Furies, flees from his mother, who is armed with brands and black serpents, while at the doorway crouch avenging Fiends.

[474] So when, outworn with anguish, she caught the madness and resolved to die, in her own heart she determines the time and manner, and accosts her sorrowful sister, with mien that veils her plan and on her brow a cloudless hope. “Sister mine, I have found a way – wish your sister joy – to return him to me or release me from my love for him. Near Ocean’s bound and the setting sun lies Ethiopia, farthest of lands, where mightiest Atlas on this shoulders turns the sphere, inset with gleaming stars. Thence a priestess of Massylian race has been shown me, warden of the fane of the Hesperides, who gave dainties to the dragon and guarded the sacred bows on the tree, sprinkling dewy honey and slumberous poppies. With her spells she professes to set free the hearts of whom she wills, but on others to bring cruel love pains; to stay the flow of rivers and turn back the stars; she awakes the ghosts of night; and you will see earth rumbling under your feet and ash trees coming down the mountains. I call heaven to witness and you, dear sister mine, and your dear life, that against my will I arm myself with magic arts! Secretly raise up a pyre in the inner court under the sky, and heap up on it’s the arms that heartless one left hanging in my bower, and all his attire and the bridal bed that was my undoing. I want to destroy all memorials of the abhorred wretch, and the priestess to directs.” Thus she speaks and is silent; pallor the while overspreads her face. Yet Anna thinks not that her sister veils her death under these strange rites; her mind dreams not of such frenzy nor does she fear anything worse than when Sychaeus died. So she makes ready as bidden . . .

[505] But the queen, when in the heart of her home the pyre rose heavenward, piled high with pine logs and hewn ilex, hangs the place with garlands and crowns it with funeral boughs. On top, upon the couch, she lays the dress he wore, the sword he left, and an image of him, knowing what was to come. Round about stand altars, and with streaming hair the priestess calls in thunder tones on thrice a hundred gods, Erebos and Chaos, and threefold Hecate, triple-faced maiden Diana. Waters, too, she had sprinkled feigned to be from the spring of Avernus, and herbs were sought, cut by moonlight with brazen sickles, and juicy with milk of black venom; sought, too, was the love charm, torn from the brow of a colt at birth before the mother snatched it . . . She herself, with holy meal and holy hands, stood beside the altars, one for unsandalled and girdle loosened; soon to die, she calls on the gods and on the stars, witnesses of her doom; then she prays to whatever power, righteous and mindful, watches over lovers unequally allied.

[522] It was night, and over the earth weary creatures were tasting the peace of slumber; the woods and wild seas had sunk to rest – the hour when stars roll midway in their gliding course, when all the land is still, and beasts and coloured birds, both those that far and near haut the limpid lakes, and those that dwell in the thorny thickets of the countryside, are couched in sleep beneath the silent night. They were soothing their cares, their hearts oblivious of sorrows. But not so the soul-racked Phoenician queen; she never sinks into sleep, nor draws darkness into eyes or heart. Her pangs redouble, and her love, swelling up, surges afresh, as she heaves with a mighty tide of passion. Thus then she begins, and thus alone revolves her thoughts in her heart: “See, hwat am I do do? Shall I once more make trial of my old wooers, only to be mocked, and shall I humbly sue for marriage with Numidians, whom I have scorned so often as husbands? Shall I then follow the Ilian ships and the Trojan’s uttermost commands? Is it because they are thankful for aid once given, and gratitude for past kindness stands firm in their mindful hearts? But who – suppose that I wished it – will suffer me, or take on so hated on those haughty ships? Ah! lost one, do you not yet understand nor perceive the treason of Laomedon’s race? What then? Shall I on my own accompany the exultant sailors in their flight? Or, surrounded by all my Tyrian band, shall I pursue, and shall I again drive seaward the men whom I could scarce tear from the Sidonian city, and bid them unfurl their sails to the winds? Nay, die as you deserve, and with the sword end your sorrow. Won over by my tears, you, my sister, you were the first to load my frenzied soul with these ills, and drive me on the foe. Ah, that I could not spend my life apart from wedlock, a blameless life, like some wild creature, and not know such cares! The faith vowed to the ashes of Sychaeus I have not kept.” Such were the cries that kept bursting from her heart.

[554] But now that all was duly ordered, and now that he was resolved on going, Aeneas was snatching sleep on his vessel’s high stern. In his sleep there appeared to him a vision of the god, as he came again with the same aspect, and once more seemed to warn him thus, in all aspects like Mercury, in voice and colouring, in golden hair and the graceful limbs of youth: “Goddess-born, when such hazard threatens, can you still slumber? Do you not see the perils that from henceforth hem you in, madman? Do you not hear the kindly breezes blowing? She, resolved on death, revolves in her heart fell craft and crime, and awakens the swirling surge of passion. Will you not flee hence in haste, while hasty flight is possible? Soon you will see the waters a welter of timbers, see fierce brands ablaze, and soon the shore flashing with flames, if dawn finds you lingering in these lands. Up then, break off delay! A fickle and changeful thing is woman ever.” So he spoke and melted into the black night.
[571] Thus indeed Aeneas, scared by the sudden vision, tears himself from sleep and bestirs his comrades. “Make haste, my men, awake and man the benches! Unfurl the sails with speed! A god sent from high heaven again spurs us to hasten our flight and cut the twisted cables. We follow you, holy among gods, whoever you are, and again joyfully obey your command. Oh, be with us, give your gracious aid, and in the sky vouchsafe kindly stars!” He spoke, and from its sheath snatches his flashing sword and strikes the hawser with the drawn blade. The same zeal catches all at once; with hurry and scurry they have quitted the shore; the sea is hidden under their fleets; lustily they churn the foam and sweep the blue waters.

[584] And now early Dawn, leaving the saffron bed of Tithonus, was sprinkling her fresh rays upon the earth. Soon as the queen from her watchtower saw the light whiten and the fleet move on with even sails, and knew the shores and harbours were void of oarsmen, thrice and four times she struck her comely breast with her hand, and tearing her golden hair, “O God,” she cries, “shall he go? Shall the intruder have made of our realm a laughingstock? Will pursuers not fetch arms and give chase from all the city, and some of them speed ships from the docks? Go, haste to bring fire, serve arms, ply oars! What say I? Where am I? What madness turns my brain? Unhappy Dido, do only now your sinful deeds come home to you? Then was the time, when you gave your crown away. Behold the pledge and promise of him who, so they say, carries wit him his ancestral gods and bore his worn-out father on his shoulders! Could I not have seized him, torn him limb from limb, and scattered the pieces on the waves? Could I not have put his men to the sword, and Ascanius himself, and served him up as a meal at his father’s table? But perhaps the issue of battle had been doubtful? Suppose it had been: doomed to death, whom had I to fear? I should have carried fire to his camp, filled his decks with flame, blotted out father and son together with the whole race, and immolated myself on top of all. O Sun, whose rays survey all that is done on earth; and Juno, agent and witness of unhappy love; Hecate, whose name is wailed by night in city streets; and Avenging Furies and gods of dying Elissa: hear me now; turn your anger upon the sins that merit it, and listen to my prayers! If that accursed wretch must needs reach harbour and come to shore, if Jove’s ordinances so demand and this is the outcome fixed: yet even so, harassed in war by the arms of a fearless nation, expelled from his territory and torn from Iulus’ embrace, let him plead for aid an see his friends cruelly slaughtered! Nor yet, when he has submitted to the terms of an unjust peace, may he enjoy his kingship or the life he longs for, but perish before his time and lie unburied on a lonely strand! This is my prayer; this last utterance I pour out with my blood. Then do you, Tyrians, persecute with hate his stock and all the race to come, and to my dust offer this tribute! Let no lover or treaty unite the nations! Arise from my ashes, unknown avenger, to harass the Trojan settlers with fire and sword – today, hereafter, whenever strength be ours! May coast with coast conflict, I pray, and sea with sea, arms with arms; war may they have, themselves and their children’s children!”

[630] With this curse she turned her mind in every direction, seeking how most quickly to end the life she loathed. Then briefly she addressed Barce, the nurse of Sychaeus, for the pyre’s black ashes held her own back in her country of long ago. “Dear nurse, bring my sister Anna here. Bid her hasten to sprinkle her body with river water and bring with her the victims and offerings ordained for atonement. This done, let her come; and veil your brows, too, with a pure chaplet. I am minded to fulfil the rites of Stygian Jove that I have duly ordered and begun, to put an end to my owes, and give over to the flames the pyre of that Dardan wretch.” She spoke; the nurse hastened her steps with an old woman’s zeal. But Dido, trembling and frantic with her dreadful design, rolling bloodshot eyes, her quivering cheeks flecked with burning spots, and pale at the imminence of death, bursts into the inner courts of the house, climbs the high pyre in a frenzy and unsheathes the Dardan sword, a gift south for no such purpose. Then, as she saw the Trojan garb and the familiar bed, pausing awhile in tearful thought, she threw herself on the couch and spoke her last words: “O relics once dear, while God and Fate allowed, take my spirit, and release me from my woes! My life is done and I have finished the course that Fortune gave; and now in majesty my shade shall pass beneath the earth. A noble city I have built; my own walls I have seen; avenging my husband, I have exacted punishment from my brother and foe – happy, too happy, had but the Dardan keels never touched our shores!” She spoke, and burying her face in the couch, “I shall die unavenged,” she cries, “but let me die! Thus, I go gladly into the dark! Let the cruel Dardan’s eyes drink in this fire from the deep, and carry with him the omen of my death!”

[663] She ceased; and even as she spoke her handmaids see her fallen on the sword, the blade reeking with blood and her hands bespattered. A scream rises to the lofty roof; Rumour riots through the stricken city. The palace rings with lamentation, with sobbing and women’s shrieks, and heaven echoes with loud wails – as though all Carthage or ancient Tyre were falling before the inrushing foe, and fierce flames were rolling on over the roofs of men, over the roofs of gods.

[672] Swooning, her sister heard, and in dismay rushed through the throng, tearing her face with her nails, and beating her breast with her fists, as she called on the dying woman by name. “Was this your purpose, sister? Did you aim your fraud at me? Was this for me the meaning of your pyre, this the meaning of your altar and fires? Forlorn, what shall I first lament? Did you scorn in death your sister’s company? You should have summoned me to share your fate; the same sword stroke, the same moment would have taken us both! Did these hands indeed build the pyre, and did my voice call on our father’s gods, in order that, when you were lying thus, I, cruel one, should be far away? You have destroyed yourself and me together, sister, the Sidonian senate and people, and your city! Bring me water to bathe her wounds and catch with my lips whatever last breath may linger!” Thus speaking, she had climbed the high steps, and, throwing her arms round her dying sister, sobbed and clasped her to her bosom, stanching with her dress the dark streams of blood. She, trying to lift her heavy eyes, swoons again, and the deep-set wound gurgles in her breast. Thrice rising, she struggles to prop herself on her elbow, thrice the bed rolled back, with wandering eyes sought high heaven’s light, and when she found it, moaned.

[693] Then almighty Juno, pitying her long agony and painful dying, sent Iris down from heaven to release her struggling soul from the prison of her flesh. For since she perished neither in the course of fate nor by a death she had earned, but wretchedly before her day, in the heat of sudden frenzy, not yet had Propserpine taken from head the golden lock and consigned her to the Stygian underworld. So Iris on dewy saffron wings flits down through the sky, trailing athwart the sun a thousand shifting tints, and halted above her head. “This offering, sacred to Dis, I take as bidden, and from your body set you free”: so she speaks and with her hand severs the lock; and therewith all the warmth passed away, and the life vanished into the winds.Embed"

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

One, two
One, two, three, four

When I was a young boy
My momma said to me
Once a woman gets your soul
You'll never shake her free
These are words of wisdom
It turns out she was right
Gotta find a lover
'Cause I need a fix tonight

(Whoa-oh)
Watch it touch me deep inside
(Whoa-oh)
Somethin' snaps inside my mind
(Whoa-oh)
When I feel it comin' ain't no sense in runnin'

I'm addicted to that rush
Every time we touch
Never get enough
'Cause I'm addicted to that rush, yeow!

Look around I stop and stare
Got to get a taste
Pretty women everywhere
We ain't got time to waste
Lookin' for a little thang
To fit into my plans
On the town, I'll hunt you down
I'm walkin' like a man

Was a habit I could break
But when I go without it
My body starts to ache

Every time we touch
Never get enough
'Cause I'm addicted to that rush
Never, never, never, never, never, get enough

I was stranded on the fault line
I got wasted on the moonshine
Too far gone

I was walking in the sundown
I was heading for the breakdown
When you're sleeping on the cold ground
Too far gone

There was a cloud hanging over me
Something just reached out and grabbed a hold of me

Inside of the belly of the whale
Outside they was beatin on the door
Somebody goin down tonight
I said boys he don't live here no more
He don't live here no more

I was riding on the night train
I been moving in the fast lane
I was only trying to kill the pain
Too far gone

Shit ain’t the same
Niggas don’t wanna stay in they own lane
I’m doing alright I’m good I can’t complain
‘Bout a piece of pussy they going against the grain
The sun shining I’m prepared for the rain
You mad I’m late but be glad that I came
That ain’t blood on my shirt bitch I’m covered in stains
Like let me explain
No Batman and Robin I was really robbing
Like I ain’t have a option
Stick up kid rob the plug now I’m running plays like the auction
If I fuck around and get jammed would you write me?
Would you make sure my commissary straight that’s unlikely
I don’t even know why I bothered to ask
I might grab the K and just spaz
I really’ll give my niggas my last
If I was down bad, would you ride ‘til the wheels fell off with expired tags?
I lost my brother an it hurt
But what hurt worse
Is watching my mother shed tears ‘cause her oldest child in a hearse
But that ain’t the half shit get deeper
I hide the pain like I’m holding up strong
Really, I’m getting weaker and weaker and weaker
I had to come to my senses get my shit together
Popped a perky I feel a little better
Devil trying to take me under won’t let him
You can run from the pain
But you damn sure can’t hide
‘Cause I promise it’s gone eat yo’ ass up inside

Verse 2
Those cold nights in a cell
No visitation
Sunny days just precipitation
Fifteen minute phone calls wasted
In the midst of fighting all these cases
I realized who the fuck gone be out there for my babies
Nobody but me
Only the strong survive
Make your mind up decide
You fell in love like Bonnie and Clyde
I ran up a check I’m in full stride
You can be here one day and gone the next
Don’t do something that you know you gone regret
I ain’t get to tell my brother that I love him
Now I’m mad at the world, upset
I thank God that I made it
Twenty odd years rip and running these streets
Go out bad is you crazy
I feel like Tyrese Gibson I’m waste deep
Speaking on the next man situation ain’t one hunna’
The devil devoured the flower my heart crumbled
I’ma fuck around and go crazy
Why do we live?
Why do we die?
What is the purpose?
Suicidal thoughts like is this shit really worth it
What the fuck did I do to deserve this
Hold ya head high when that bullshit start to surface
I’m trying to stay strong for my mama but the shit just ain’t working

La Ley,Aqui,neg,"2 ContributorsAquí Lyrics[Letra de ""Aquí""]

El hombre esta acercándose
Hacia el encuentro con la frontera
Un cambio, una decisión
La puerta abierta de una nueva era

El mundo que gira al revés
Pretende que navegue en él
Ahogando mis ideas

El ruido, ambiente y soledad
De la ciudad nos aíslan de todo
Por eso comencé a escarbar
Para encontrar los mil y un tesoros

El mundo que gira al revés
Pretende sumergirme en él
Ahogando mis ideas

Aquí tengo el presentimiento
Que aquí nada voy a arrastrar desde aquí
Solo voy a vivir mi hoy ahora

Lamento hay en mi corazón
No es imaginación, es verdadero
Mientras el tiempo anuncia que
Por un segundo casi fui un señuelo

Quemando mis ideas

Cuando hasta un ciego puede ver
Que nos callamos sin saber
Perdiéndonos la vuelta

Aquí tengo el presentimiento
Que aquí nada voy a arrastrar desde aquí
Solo voy a vivir mi hoy ahora

Cuando hasta un ciego puede ver
Que nos callamos sin saber
Perdiéndonos la vuelta

Solo voy a vivir mi hoy ahora

A nuestras vidas que ya han vivido tanto
Que han visto mil colores de sábanas de seda
Y cuando llueve te gusta caminar
Vas abrazándome sin prisa aunque te mojes

Es toda una aventura, no le hace falta nada

Que ve nuestras caras la humedad
Y te haré compañía más allá de la vida
Yo te juro que arriba te amaré más

Except to smoke and have some good fun
With their dogs and wives and new sons
And they probably never will hug

Just a woman who will always love
Just a unhappy with a man

And what I, and what I found is that we

Now no one sees her husband
'Cause her ass has caught the harvest
And her pants have got a good fill

Starin' at the stars through her back screen door
She tries and tries to make it all work out
No matter what she does
She's left standin' in the middle of doubt

In a lonely night
And in the pourin' rain
You can count on me

Sometimes she cries
When she's alone at night
Sometimes she weeps
When she's feelin' cold and weak
Sometimes the pain
It just tears her up inside
Sometimes she cries
Ooh, I wonder why

Mercy don't have a lover no more
Plays with her pillow
Stares at the bedroom floor
Used to have a million
They've come and gone
No matter what she does
She can't figure out what she's doin' wrong

Livin', lovin', givin' everything you've got
After all the heartache
Maybe give love just one more shot, yeah

In a lonely night
And in the pourin' rain
The only thing I really wanna know is why

It opens your heart, everything is new
And you know time will always find a way
To let your heart believe it's true

A whisper, a word
Promises you give
You feel it in the heartbeat of the day
You know this is the way love is

So let the tears go, they will flow away
For you know love will always let you fly
How far a heart can fly away

[Verso 1]
Con él en la ciudad, con él paseas
Con él vas a volar, conmigo juegas
Con él siempre con el, y yo estoy solo
Y no me siento bien cuando me pongo loco
Con el siempre con el, y yo estoy harto
No me siento bien con el papel de un santo
Esto es así, de cualquier modo
Tú te vas con él y yo me quedo solo

[Estribillo]
Y mira qué ironía, querida
Él no te entrega nada
En cambio yo te ofrezco mi vida
Con sólo una mirada
Y mira qué ironía querida
Él no te entrega nada
En cambio yo soy a tu medida
El único que te ama

It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
Until your heart

You call me on the phone, you left me all alone
All I get from you is shellshock
Another day goes by and all I do is cry
All I get from you is shellshock
I'd tell the world and save my soul
But rain falls down and I feel cold
A cold that sleeps within my heart
It tears the Earth and Sun apart
But that's the way (that’s the way) I can win (ah)

When we walk through open doorways
Counting time in one or more ways
We can't find our peace of mind
And life becomes a life of crime
And that's the day (that’s the way) I call your name (ah)
I came to you, (that’s the way) I called in vain (ah)
You lost the faith (that’s the way) within your heart (ah)
The fire in your soul from the end to the start

The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

I've been good and I've been bad
But common sense I've never had
No matter how I try and try
I hide the truth behind a lie

Into every sunny day
A little rain must fall
And without the rain upon us
Would we ever grow

'Till I put my trust in you
You took away my pain

I allowed my fears to take hold of me
Had nowhere to run 'cause
I was too deep
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me

Figured out what I did wrong

Lamb Of God,Black Label,neg,"15 ContributorsBlack Label LyricsThe human confrontation, I've built a phobia
It takes my essence somewhere
Somewhere to take control

I may be far from rocking
I am the one alone
I may be far behind lines
And made them turn away

I want to know, hey you watch out!
I've made them turn to cripple, hey you watch out!
When I will know, who'll know, back fight!
Why time would let me die to control

I fear nothing, why don't you know
I rip my mind and why don't you bleed
I fear no one, why you turn back
I may not stop

My freedom can't contain but tell me
The pain I liberate
Riff hostility to anyone
Has made us so much hate
I made them turn from hate but tell me
The pain and suffering
I made them turn from hate but tell me

I say you're at fault you say I'm selfish
Now the accusations must be paid with the

Strain of losing you
Pain of feeling blue
You're hurt and I'm lost
Tell me what are we gonna do?

Please come back and kiss away the pain
We can be happy once again
Please come back and kiss away the pain
We can make sunshine from the rain

Without you my life has no music
Rhyme and rhythm cease to be
Close friends tell me that you're acting heartsick
Is it all because you're missing me?

The pain is clouding your eyes
Pain too deep to disguise
You're blue, baby, I am too
Tell me, tell me, tell me what are we gonna do?

Ed Bruce,The Last Cowboy Song,neg,"2 ContributorsThe Last Cowboy Song LyricsThis is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost

He rides a feed lot and clerks in a market
On weekends selling tobacco and beer
His dreams of tomorrow surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball Ol' Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis L'Amour has told us his tale
And Willie and Waylon and me sing about him
And wish to God we could have ridden his trail

The Old Chisholm Trail is covered in concrete now
And they truck 'em to market in fifty foot rigs
They blow by his market never slowing to reason
Like living and dying was all he did
This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz

Forever we'll go out into the night with survival in all our eyes
With knives in hand we stab at the sands of time
To turn back and unwind
Under the death of an age when we were becoming stronger than...
With terror in our eyes, we wait on these skies to bring a new chapter

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

Like lions we tow the line, blood sewn pact with truth inside
With knives in hand we stab at the sands of time
To turn back and unwind
Under the death of age, we were becoming stronger than...
With terror in our eyes, we wait on these skies to bring a new chapter

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

Looked around the week was gone
Worked my fingers to the bone, I should've known
That the struggle I had faced wasn't over
Drama won't leave me alone

When the world all around me gives me every reason to faint
My first and the last real defense is to stand and say

My praise will keep me moving on

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne

My praise will keep me moving on

No matter what the circumstance
I know my life is n his hands
The storms may come but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

That I get somewhat discouraged when trials come my way
But this will be my choice, will be my choice

De cuenta que no exististe
Tu de mi
Olvida que un día me viste

Ya lo ves
Los dos nos equivocamos
Y es mejor
Que otros caminos sigamos

Y que esta despedida
Sea por el bien de todos
Inventare algún modo
Para vivir sin ti

Te juro que nadie mas
Te amara como yo
Mas hoy, por ti mi pecho arde
Porque me duele decirte que
A ti he llegado tarde

Aunque no te vuelva a ver
Quiero que sepas que haré
Por ti, mi viaje sin boleto
Y en la distancia siempre seras

Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocío
Lagrimas que vienen del corazón
Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocío
Lagrimas que brotan porque ya no hay amor

[Verso 1]
Pudiste haberme dicho que no
Que no sentías nada por mí
Que lo nuestro nunca fue algo especial
La vida cambia y todo tiene final

[Verso 2]
Una aventura fuí para tí
Y fácilmente yo en tus redes caí
Un trago amargo que de tí recibí
Ahora no sé, no sé qué será de mí

If you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

And if you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

And what I witnessed from your heart
'Cause I knew, baby girl, it was ready to start
A fantasy that was oh-so true

That you and me, we were meant to be
In this world full of love, you were made for me

Baby girl, in my fantasy
You would be more than happy, you would be with me

Rolling her homeward
With blood on our knives

Vapor to float on
Still we roll on through the night

Taken down by the hounds, one by one

Following the ghost down

Running in circles, a mouse on the table

Culture Club,The War Song,neg,"7 ContributorsThe War Song Lyrics[Chorus]
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

[Verse 1]
People fill the world
With narrow confidence
Like a child at birth
A man with no defense
What's mine's my own
I won't give it to you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

[Verse 2]
Man is far behind
In the search for something new
Like a Philistine
We're burning witches too
This world of fate
Must be designed for you
It matters what you say
It matters what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me
[Chorus]
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

(War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war)

[Bridge]
After the bird has flown
He walked ten thousand miles back home
You can't do that to me, no
You can't do that to me
You can't do that to me, no
You can't do that to me

(War
War)
[Verse 3]
In this heart of mine
I'll find a place for you
For black or white
For all the children, too

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

[Chorus]
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid

Skillet,The Last Night,neg,"24 ContributorsThe Last Night Lyrics[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
You come to me with scars on your wrist
You tell me this will be the last night feeling like this
I just came to say goodbye
I didn't want you to see me cry, I'm fine
But I know it's a lie

[Chorus]
This is the last night you'll spend alone
Look me in the eyes so I know you know
I'm everywhere you want me to be
The last night you'll spend alone
I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go
I'm everything you need me to be

[Verse 2]
Your parents say everything is your fault
But they don't know you like I know you they don't know you at all
I'm so sick of when they say
It's just a phase, you'll be o.k. you're fine
But I know it's a lie

[Chorus]
This is the last night you'll spend alone
Look me in the eyes so I know you know
I'm everywhere you want me to be
The last night you'll spend alone
I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go

The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one more wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas Darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmas-ing with you

There's always something new
But every day's a holiday

I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say

That I wish you a merry Christmas

Their old familiar carols play
And mild and sweet their songs repeat
Of peace on earth good will to men

And the bells are ringing (Peace on Earth)
Like a choir they're singing (Peace on Earth)

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song

Take back the holly and mistletoe
Silver bells on string

Don't want a Christmas that's blue
Take back the tinsel, stockings, and bows
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you

They don't matter to me
All that I want, it can't be found

You are my dream come true

You've got to fight for a love that's true
Climb every mountain
See every trial and tribulation through
I'm here to tell you
That's only half the lesson
Now if you want a girl to come to you
You've got to leave a little room for guessin'

Oh, just be easy baby
That girl will come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
She'll be easy, too

Don't you know it's just a fool who plays the part
Running a girl down like she's a game in a school yard?
Now if she waits, you should turn and let her alone
And she'll come to you just as sure as you're born

Be easy, baby
That girl will come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
She'll be easy, too

Don't you know

Running her down like a mouse at the cheese?

Get too excited, and she's off in another direction

[Verso 1]
A veces me elevo, doy mil volteretas
A veces me encierro tras puertas abiertas
A veces te cuento por qué este silencio
Y es que a veces soy tuyo y a veces del viento
A veces de un hilo y a veces de un ciento
Y hay veces, mi vida, te juro que pienso
Por qué es tan difícil sentir como siento
Sentir, cómo siento que sea difícil

[Verso 2]
A veces te miro y a veces te dejas
Me prestas tus alas, revisas tus huellas
A veces por todo aunque nunca me falles
A veces soy tuyo y a veces de nadie
A veces te juro de veras que siento no darte la vida entera
Darte sólo esos momentos
¿Por qué es tan difícil vivir? sólo es eso
Vivir, sólo es eso... ¿Por qué es tan difícil?

[Estribillo]
Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser
Cuando nadie me ve, pongo el mundo al revés
Cuando nadie me ve, no me limita la piel
Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser

Te escribo desde los centros de mi propia existencia
Donde nacen las ansias, la infinita esencia
Hay cosas muy tuyas que yo no comprendo
Y hay cosas tan mías, pero es que yo no las veo

Que a oscuras te puedo, lo siento no acierto
No enciendas las luces que tengo desnudos el alma y el cuerpo

Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser

I Lost You [2x]
You slipped from your costume
Like an actress in this tragedy
You're just an apparition in a haunting mystery
I fear that you've passed over me
And there's nothing I can do because
I Lost You

[Verse 1]
Just like a rich man who is careless of his change
I took you for granted
And then you went to strangers
From deep within my heart I feel a distant fading pulse
A poor woman looking for last coin in her purse

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Just like a counterfeit you pass from palm to palm
I chased the one I surely loved to someone else's arms
I mislaid my senses, now that's easy to say
A fool who took his pleasure but then threw his love away

Like any other place, it's warm up inside
Sittin' down and waitin' for a ride
Beneath the skyway

But I know that he took the rent
And I know that he went and spent all my loving

And I'm not rich, but I don't care

Mil campanas suenan en mi corazón
¡Qué difícil es pedir perdón!

I remember when we were kids
We shared all the hurt and tears

No matter what the weather
(What the weather

We were always together

Then we grew up
And time went on
We became separated

When I went off to school
My sweet Toby waited
I went off to school
My sweet Toby waited

Was a sad day
When Toby went away
Was a sad day
When Toby went away

Expected to find my Toby waiting
Called her on her private phone
She didn't answer
Something was wrong

I ran all the way to her house
Rang her bell
Her mother answered and told me
To come and sit a spell

I sat down to try to be prepared
For what she'd say
And what she said
Brought tears to my eyes
I couldn't push away

Toby left on a cloudy, rainy day
She went to sing with the angels
Toby's gone away

It was a sad day
Oh, oh, Toby went away
It was a sad day
When Toby went away
It was a sad day
Oh, oh, when Toby went away
It was a sad day
When Toby went away

Was a sad day
When Toby went away
Was a sad, sad day

And, like starlings, flown away

When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May

Throw your job away

Now's the time to trust to your wanderlust
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait

In our mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together

While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet
When it rains, we'll laugh at the weather

And if you're good
I'll search for wood
So you can cook while I stand looking

Beans could get no keener

Matt Brouwer,Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,pos,"1 ContributorThe Diary of a Nobody (Chapter XII) LyricsA serious discussion concerning the use and value of my diary. Lupin’s opinion of ’Xmas. Lupin’s unfortunate engagement is on again.

December 17.—As I open my scribbling diary I find the words “Oxford Michaelmas Term ends.” Why this should induce me to indulge in retrospective I don’t know, but it does. The last few weeks of my diary are of minimum interest. The breaking off of the engagement between Lupin and Daisy Mutlar has made him a different being, and Carrie a rather depressing companion. She was a little dull last Saturday, and I thought to cheer her up by reading some extracts from my diary; but she walked out of the room in the middle of the reading, without a word. On her return, I said: “Did my diary bore you, darling?”

She replied, to my surprise: “I really wasn’t listening, dear. I was obliged to leave to give instructions to the laundress. In consequence of some stuff she puts in the water, two more of Lupin’s coloured shirts have run and he says he won’t wear them.”

I said: “Everything is Lupin. It’s all Lupin, Lupin, Lupin. There was not a single button on my shirt yesterday, but I made no complaint.”

Carrie simply replied: “You should do as all other men do, and wear studs. In fact, I never saw anyone but you wear buttons on the shirt-fronts.”

I said: “I certainly wore none yesterday, for there were none on.”

Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the evening, and Cummings never does. I fear they don’t get on well with Lupin.

December 18.—Yesterday I was in a retrospective vein—to-day it is prospective. I see nothing but clouds, clouds, clouds. Lupin is perfectly intolerable over the Daisy Mutlar business. He won’t say what is the cause of the breach. He is evidently condemning her conduct, and yet, if we venture to agree with him, says he won’t hear a word against her. So what is one to do? Another thing which is disappointing to me is, that Carrie and Lupin take no interest whatever in my diary.

I broached the subject at the breakfast-table to-day. I said: “I was in hopes that, if anything ever happened to me, the diary would be an endless source of pleasure to you both; to say nothing of the chance of the remuneration which may accrue from its being published.”

Both Carrie and Lupin burst out laughing. Carrie was sorry for this, I could see, for she said: “I did not mean to be rude, dear Charlie; but truly I do not think your diary would sufficiently interest the public to be taken up by a publisher.”

I replied: “I am sure it would prove quite as interesting as some of the ridiculous reminiscences that have been published lately. Besides, it’s the diary that makes the man. Where would Evelyn and Pepys have been if it had not been for their diaries?”

Carrie said I was quite a philosopher; but Lupin, in a jeering tone, said: “If it had been written on larger paper, Guv., we might get a fair price from a butterman for it.”

As I am in the prospective vein, I vow the end of this year will see the end of my diary.
December 19.—The annual invitation came to spend Christmas with Carrie’s mother—the usual family festive gathering to which we always look forward. Lupin declined to go. I was astounded, and expressed my surprise and disgust. Lupin then obliged us with the following Radical speech: “I hate a family gathering at Christmas. What does it mean? Why someone says: ‘Ah! we miss poor Uncle James, who was here last year,’ and we all begin to snivel. Someone else says: ‘It’s two years since poor Aunt Liz used to sit in that corner.’ Then we all begin to snivel again. Then another gloomy relation says ‘Ah! I wonder whose turn it will be next?’ Then we all snivel again, and proceed to eat and drink too much; and they don’t discover until I get up that we have been seated thirteen at dinner.”

December 20.—Went to Smirksons’, the drapers, in the Strand, who this year have turned out everything in the shop and devoted the whole place to the sale of Christmas cards. Shop crowded with people, who seemed to take up the cards rather roughly, and, after a hurried glance at them, throw them down again. I remarked to one of the young persons serving, that carelessness appeared to be a disease with some purchasers. The observation was scarcely out of my mouth, when my thick coat-sleeve caught against a large pile of expensive cards in boxes one on top of the other, and threw them down. The manager came forward, looking very much annoyed, and picking up several cards from the ground, said to one of the assistants, with a palpable side-glance at me: “Put these amongst the sixpenny goods; they can’t be sold for a shilling now.” The result was, I felt it my duty to buy some of these damaged cards.

I had to buy more and pay more than intended. Unfortunately I did not examine them all, and when I got home I discovered a vulgar card with a picture of a fat nurse with two babies, one black and the other white, and the words: “We wish Pa a Merry Christmas.” I tore up the card and threw it away. Carrie said the great disadvantage of going out in Society and increasing the number of our friends was, that we should have to send out nearly two dozen cards this year.

December 21.—To save the postman a miserable Christmas, we follow the example of all unselfish people, and send out our cards early. Most of the cards had finger-marks, which I did not notice at night. I shall buy all future cards in the daytime. Lupin (who, ever since he has had the appointment with a stock and share broker, does not seem over-scrupulous in his dealings) told me never to rub out the pencilled price on the backs of the cards. I asked him why. Lupin said: “Suppose your card is marked 9d. Well, all you have to do is to pencil a 3—and a long down-stroke after it—in front of the ninepence, and people will think you have given five times the price for it.”

In the evening Lupin was very low-spirited, and I reminded him that behind the clouds the sun was shining. He said: “Ugh! it never shines on me.” I said: “Stop, Lupin, my boy; you are worried about Daisy Mutlar. Don’t think of her any more. You ought to congratulate yourself on having got off a very bad bargain. Her notions are far too grand for our simple tastes.” He jumped up and said: “I won’t allow one word to be uttered against her. She’s worth the whole bunch of your friends put together, that inflated, sloping-head of a Perkupp included.” I left the room with silent dignity, but caught my foot in the mat.

December 23.—I exchanged no words with Lupin in the morning; but as he seemed to be in exuberant spirits in the evening, I ventured to ask him where he intended to spend his Christmas. He replied: “Oh, most likely at the Mutlars’.”

In wonderment, I said: “What! after your engagement has been broken off?”

Lupin said: “Who said it is off?”

Do You understand the price
Or does the Father guard Your heart for now
So You can sleep tonight

Go to sleep my son
Go and chase Your dreams
This world can wait for one more moment
Go and sleep in peace

I believe the glory of heaven
Is lying in my arms tonight
But Lord I ask that He for just this moment
Simply be my child

Third Day,Merry Christmas,pos,"1 ContributorMerry Christmas LyricsThere's a little girl trembling on a cold December morn
Crying for mama's arms
At an orphanage just outside a little China town
Where the forgotten are

But half a world away I hang the stockings by the fire
And dream about the day when I can finally call you mine

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

As I hang the tinsel on the tree and watch the twinkling lights
I'm warmed by the fire's glow
Outside the children tumble in the wonderland of white
And make angels in the snow

But half a world away you try your best to fight the tears
And hope that Heaven's Angels come to carry you here

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

So tonight before you go to sleep, I'll hold you in my arms
And tell you from my heart

It's never been quite the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no colors, just silence

We asked you what you'd seen
You said you didn't care

And we won't tell a soul
And you really must do this

And at least in love
The hearts won't be apart for too long
So don't say it again

If you really love him then tell me that you love him again, and go
I can see your love changing hands before, too long
If you really love him then tell me that you love him again, and go

If you really love him, tell me that you love him again
If you really love him, tell me that you love him again

I let go of your hand as you suggest I go
And with that I was gone
And after all that was said
Was it meaningless

To ""Walkin' in the Sand""?
And I'd like you to know
That my love is love that you can be sure of

Solito me quede y no dije nada
Tal vez esta cancion te suene triste
Pero me esta llevando la Chingada

Y lo que me digas de memoria me lo se
Tus mentiras no me serviran de nada
Te lo perdiste ojala te vaya bien
Yo me voy por donde vine
Se que no me perdere

Abandonao un exiliado
De tu boca, de tus manos, de tu corazon
Sin rumbo fijo voy de la mano
De mis sueños vagabundos
Y me importa poco que me diga el mundo
El abandonao

El tiempo es el doctor de los dolidos
Para sanar las penas que te embriagan
Yo siempre me las curo con tequila
Oyendo a Jose Alfredo y al Sabina
Y no pasa nada se que no me morire
Como dice la cancion asi es la vida
Mirame a los ojos aunque sea la ultima vez
Solo vine a despedirme no te vine a detener

Marsha Ambrosius,Lose Myself,pos,"4 ContributorsLose Myself LyricsI can love you better
Lose myself in love ..

I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all i ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all i ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Try to make me feel like i was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me no!

I had to lose myself so i could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Love you better, lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is?

Couldn?t tell me i was in love when i needed it
When, all i ever wanted was love
Should a told me i was worth receiving it
But all i ever wanted was love
There?s something awkward about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see!

Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So i could love you better
Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is?

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And i couldn?t love you perfectly with that fear in my head
So i perilously had to face the danger
So i could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul i said!
So i could make it better

I had to lose myself had to lose myself
So i could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Make it better

Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is

And so it goes that i never meant to hurt you
Couldn?t stay but i never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things i just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot of years i suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years i can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind!
I had to lose myself so i could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Love you better baby better baby
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So i could love you better baby
Had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love
Yeah, so I can love you better baby lose myself in love
Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is!

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did
Great love to absorb all the misuse i did

And i?d do it all again because for you i live

Yo soy de aquí

Yo soy de aquí
Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer
Del callejón con los panas fumando
Con fama soñando, cantando y llegué
Lejos del barrio hasta otra ciudad
Y en otro cielo se escuchó mi canción
Pero lo que jamás podré olvidar
Es de dónde salí, pues eso es lo que soy

[Verso 1: Yandel]
Yo soy de aquí, bien orgulloso me siento
Directo de P.R., los reyes del movimiento
Don, Don, Yandel, esto no es un invento
Esto es algo que he cotiza'o, son más de quinientos mil
A mi público yo le doy las gracias
Porque a pesar de la distancia nos siguen con ansias
Don, Don, Yandel, mucho porte y elegancia
Talento desde la infancia (P.R.!)
Porque soy de aquí (De aquí)
Pa' 'lante voy a seguir (Voy a seguir)
No voy a permitir (Permitir)

Es de dónde salí, pues eso es lo que soy

Death Cab For Cutie,Someday You Will Be Loved,pos,"17 ContributorsSomeday You Will Be Loved Lyrics[Verse 1]
I once knew a girl in the years of my youth
With eyes like the summer, all beauty and truth
But in the morning I fled, left a note and it read:
""Someday you will be loved""

[Verse 2]
I cannot pretend that I felt any regret
'Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
And as the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved

[Chorus]
You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
'Cause someday you will be loved

[Verse 3]
You may feel alone when you're falling asleep
And every time tears roll down your cheeks
But I know your heart belongs to someone you've yet to meet
And someday you will be loved

You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams

Never once before did I really see the light
'Cause they were barely friends and merely lovers
And it's taken what you've given me to feel like I do tonight

I am moved by the spirit
And I am here to testify

I found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees and reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't never get enough
I found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love

You've given love a brand new meaning
Bound by a higher power than I've ever known before
Safe in your faithful arms I am leaning
Once I was lost but now I'm found forevermore

And I am moved by the spirit
And I am here to testify

Did he break your heart
He started acting crazy
When you wanted to part

He left some scars on your face
And bruised your grace with friends

Confused you with his smile
Tricked you with his letters
And his fancy style

He pushed a ring on you
Before you knew
You're isolated now
It will be okay

Be patient until he figures it out

Until the philosophy
Which holds one race superior
And another inferior
Is finally and permanently
Discredited and abandoned
Everywhere is war

[Verse 2]
Until there is no longer first class
Or second class citizens of any nation
That until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance
Than the color of his eyes
I've got to say ""war""

[Verse 3]
That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Then we say ""war""

[Verse 4]
That until that day the dream of lasting peace
World-citizenship and the rule of
International morality will remain
Just a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never obtained
And everywhere is war

Can you believe this world's got the nerve to insist they won't trade for a better one?
Can you believe this world's yelling out in the dark it wants to be left alone?
Can you believe this world never would have had the chance without us giving it blood?
Can you believe this world lacks the common courtesy to thank us all for the love?

Can you believe this world's like a tyrant taking over anything that it wants?
Can you believe this world's like a wounded martyr worried if his commitment is gone?
Can you believe this world's like a vagrant in the gutter talking nothing is wrong?

Can you believe this world's just a double dealing joker, going to stick to his guns?
Can you believe this world's just a television blaring, a million devils at once?

Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang

And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But u can always tell your better half
Always tell your better half of the story
It goes well with the better side of your face u show on TV
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't start a revolution
What's in the constitution? Is this illusion that we buy?
You cut the wings and then you say fly
You say the hero is the one that died
But the true hero is the one who doesn't live a lie and understands
That there's an end out of the cycle
Who's the master? Who's the disciple?
You can do what you can, but will you do it again?
So what's the plan?
Looks like we are going to get war again

Can't be born again, who's gone again?
Who's going to gain out of this war again?

Soon again u will see it all begin again
Sink again, and that will make you think again

And when they call you go
When they are wrong you know
And you will fallow, and you will swallow
Again like long ago the bomb will blow
So sit back relax and enjoy the show
Cuz you are as cold as snow and I am here below

All the darkness will burn
Recalling pictures of olden days

In the shadows remain

Till you share all my pain

Now we step into the fire

Till the morning unfolds

And the trail has run cold
All the violence that fills the world
Leaving nothing for shame
This is when so much pain will call out
Such things I have learned

[Intro]
Something special
¡Aventura!

[Verso 1]
La niña duerme tan profundo
Sólo un fuego o un disparo la puede despertar
Tan inocente, apenas tiene nueve años
Y mañana quizás lo entenderá
Que un extraño en su cama tocó su cuerpecito
Con malicia y sin piedad
Ella no entiende que hay personas en la vida
Que se animan sólo para hacer maldad

[Coro: Henry Santos & Romeo Santos]
¿Y quién diablos fue?
Un desgraciado sin corazón
Dígame cómo entró
Quizás olvidaron cerrar la puerta
Sólo saben que hizo el daño y se marchó

[Verso 2: Romeo Santos]
El día siguiente un oficial
Preguntaba a sus padres cómo fue que sucedió
La madre sufre y el padre pensativo
No habían huellas de aquel que la violó
La niña llora, se imagina que ayer mientras dormía
Algo malo le pasó
Más ve el sangrero en su ropa
Policías en su cuarto y un poquito de dolor

And I did what I did

Five whole years of my life, I spent mourning you and why?
Girl, you're still alive
You're too dead to keep inside
You take the years, you keep it all
I finally think I might be alright

So let's just let it all go, 'cause nothing can change
And if something is lost, then there's something to frame
I just sing what I have
And I got this girl, not yet crushed by the world
I'll count the freckles on her face one, two, three hundred times a day

And sing a new song

So deep inside me, hot in this frozen cave

Destruction,Hate Is My Fuel,neg,"3 ContributorsHate Is My Fuel LyricsA poisoned culture - Based on lies, war & deceit
Slaughterhouse philosophy - Cruel butchers are hard to beat
The law of the game - Is the law of the bloody blade
Dictated by lunacy - It's the fail death serenade

War - As the essence of a painful life
Decay - The stream of death agony will ride

Hate - Hate is my fuel
The mob is just tool
Hate - Hate is my fuel
I'm the lord of misrule

Death brings us together as one - The feel to be second to none
Shameful should be the gluttonous - What makes a real genius?
Erases all the treasures - Wipes out all fame, affluence and wealth
Recognize the afterlife freedom - Won't be based on stealth

War - As the essence of a painful life
Decay - The stream of death agony will ride

Hate - Hate is my fuel
The mob is just tool
Hate - Hate is my fuel
I'm the lord of misrule
You might also likeInsanity - We do rape, wreck and then - We search for an excuse
Decay - We all gonna rot, we're all the same on the final cruise
Modesty - Is so hard to find, is this a curse - Is this real?
Consistency - Is a gift of life, education is the deal

Hate - Hate is my fuel
The mob is just tool
Hate - Hate is my fuel
I'm the lord of misruleEmbed"

Ricardo Arjona,La Mujer Que No Sone,neg,"1 ContributorLa Mujer que no Soñé LyricsLa de lentes, la pasada de moda
La aburrida, la intelectual
La que prefiere una biblioteca a una discoteca
Es con la que vivo yo

La que todos tachan de fea
Y en el bus nadie le cede el lugar
La que es más que una presea para enseñar
Jamás será modelo de televisión
Porque aún no hacen anuncios para el corazón

Me gusta porque es autentica y vive sin recetas
De esas que tratan de vestir al amor de etiqueta
He venido a parar con la mujer que no soñe jamas
Pero tambien jamas fui tan feliz

La que ya ni se pinta la boca
Defraudada de coquetear
La que es más que una aguja para enhebrar
Si su enemigo aparece acechando el espejo
Ella le da una sonrisa y aniquila el complejo

Me gusta porque es autentica y vive sin recetas
De esas que tratan de vestir al amor de etiqueta
He venido a parar con la mujer que no soñe jamas

When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart
When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away, you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

[Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

[Verse 2]
When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart
Tell her you're glad
It's over, in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back?
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just

Behold, I
Crawl!
War!

[Verse 1]
Do you hear revolution's call?
Time to fight our own denial
Warmongers keep us locked in fear
Invoke the past, a moment of tears
An ugly truth, put forth by our youth
Under the threat of patriotic brute

So use your rage!
It is a weapon, we now must engage
Let trumpets sound our call!
Or by their lies we will fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing!

[Chorus]
Sing revolution's song (When they say die!)
Die for America!

War!

[Verse 2]
They say that freedom isn't free
It's paid with the lives of sons and families
'Cause blood is their new currency
And oil pumps the heart of money

So fight as one, without a fucking gun
Words are the bullets to this revolution

Use your pain!
The battlegrounds, the streets are ablaze
Excess will pave their path!
The winds of change, our bloodbath

[Pre-Chorus]
Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing!

[Chorus]
Sing revolution's song (When they say die!)
Die for America!
[Interlude]
{Spoken lines that are too quiet to make out}
Today, we build this future

[Bridge 1]
Power and prejudice
Actions they use to pit against
Terror, insurgency
Words uses to scare conformity
It's propaganda, it's their hypocrisy
Free to choose our own slavery
All suffer humanity

So fight for all that you love
Scream, choking with foot upon throat
Blind, scar spangled eyes
Death, no more the truth you will hide
No, no!

[Bridge 3]
So how do they sleep?
While our mothers weep
They're selling our souls
And our blood for oil

[Verse 3]
Our generation can be the fucking one
That overcomes the greed of corrupt nations
Have no shame!
You're not alone in thinking this is fucking insane
Rise up and take your stand!
And curl the fingers of your hand

[Verse 4]
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't have the answers
But with every ounce of strength
I'll vow to fight this cancer
Didn't say I want to lead
I just might let you down
Didn't say believe in me
Just hold this common ground
I'm just as lost as you
And probably more confused
So fucking far from perfect
My mind wrecked from abuse
There's something fucking wrong
When war takes sons and daughters
Our lambs misled to slaughter!

[Outro]

Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

But their tribes fought with each other
So, their love could never be

Randy Newman,It's Money That I Love,pos,"5 ContributorsIt’s Money That I Love LyricsI don't love the mountains
And I don't love the sea
And I don't love Jesus
He never done a thing for me
I ain't pretty like my sister
Or smart like my dad
Or good like my mama

It's money that I love
It's money that I love

They say that money
Can't buy love in this world
But it'll get you a half-pound of cocaine
And a sixteen-year old girl
And a great big long limousine
On a hot September night
Now that may not be love
But it is all right

One, two
It's money that I love
Wanna kiss you
Three, four
It's money that I love

Upon your silver shield

And though your jewel-encrusted blade

Sending arrows into the dark
But I'm just lookin for a place where I can fall apart

Throw all of my junk into the Alamo trunk
And I pull out into the lane

There was a time when the road was mine
And the path was lined with sparks
Now I'm just lookin for a place where I can fall apart

Nobody wants to talk about it
We're all scared we're gonna lose our share of the dream
Can't live without it

I'm a promo monkey in a cage

Sever from fear before taking flight

Seem like a long, long while
Sometimes the thoughts of you
Bring tears to my eyes

While the times that bring a smile
I remember what you told me
We would always be close in our hearts
Must be easy to sleep in another man's arms
We're so damn far apart

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
Just making me a fool
I can almost see your face
On a real lonely night

There's a picture of you hanging on my wall
Such a lovely girl
Sometimes I feel like breaking into pieces
Like you did to my world

Oh, and other times I wanna hold her in my arms
Like a ball in chain
I look till I'm through loving you
I can never love again

Ever feel alone
Ever feel like crying
Lost child in a store
Ever feel life pushing, shoving you away
Ever feel like breaking down, funeral in the rain

Feel like slipping away

A head that's full of rage, better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain, better believe it

Ever feel like lying
Down inside a grave
Listen to the eulogy
A buyer of the hate
Ever dance beside the devil
Taste the barrel of a gauge
Ever pull the trigger

And smile at the thought of me failing

Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings
Last night, I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing
Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony
While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free

Oh yeah, well you know I don't get off on working day after day
I wanna have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when it's going my way
And there's nothing like a party when its kicking into gear

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm getting ready for a party tonight
Yes I'm getting ready to cruise
And if you've got something for me
I've got something for you

Baby, it's a party and nobody cares
What we're doing there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party

That it's a sin that way we live to die
You know, there's never been a more natural thing
There's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie

Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?""
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be so, o, o, o""
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer

Made sure that he was dead

In dreams of black, beyond the bounds of a withered witch's spell
Where the doors surely are locked when the sun threatens to wane
Where shamblers dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day
Liars line the roads at dawn
Watchful eyes are upon you held
Sacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell
Blood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh
Where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead
Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man
Into the tower, never go; the horrors multiply
The gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed
The rivers flow with poison
The sands swallow you whole
The ghouls that roam this darkened wood are thirsting for your throat

Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds

Golden light, oh what a fight
Another sleepless night, her dress is filigree
She tells me all her secrets then I'm back on the street

It's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night
In your head, in your head

Do you see the fire heavy lit before its time?
Know you the color of the end of the end of the end
Silence is dancing to a beating drum
Money is nothing but a loaded gun

And it's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night
In your head, in your head

It's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night

In the midst of a moment can you break the bull?
Can you tame the demon?

I've traveled 'round this country, crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories, brought joy to other's lives

And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home, so

And the kids are singing ""Jingle Bells"" around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on

The Damned Things,Handbook For The Recently Deceased,neg,"4 ContributorsHandbook for the Recently Deceased Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're breaking up, getting lost in the static
You're getting blurry right in front of me
The footsteps growing quiet in the hallway
As I let go, let go

The gravity that attracts us helps us implode
Or else we'd keep dividing
But I know, I know

[Chorus]
We're aimed straight at each other
We are doomed to crash
So strike up a fire, light up the town
'Cause we're aimed straight at each other
This was meant to last
So don't try to fight it, the chaos will calm us down

[Verse 2]
Our lips move but we speak in a language
That neither one of us can understand
You sleepwalk through the tape and the sirens
I let go, let go

The rules of our attraction were carved in stone
And yet you keep resisting
But I know, I know

Hoy en un sueño te encontré
Como un loco te besé
Y estrenamos nuestro amor
Hoy lejos de la realidad
Conocí la eternidad
En un abrazo tuyo

Cómo me duele saber
Que esto es algo que solo soñé
Nos desgarramos de placer
Una promesa quedó
Nos juramos lealtad sin testigos
Comprometimos el alma

Mountain,Theme From An Imaginary Western,neg,"2 ContributorsTheme from an Imaginary Western LyricsWhen the wagons leave the city
For the forest and further on
Painted wagon of the morning
Dusty roads where they've gone
Sometimes travelin' through the darkness
At the summer comin' home
Foreign faces by the wayside
Look as if they hadn't known
All the sad was in their eyes
And the desert that's dry
In a country town
Where the map was found
Oh, the dancing and the singing
Oh, the music when they play
Oh, the fire that they saw there
On the grave of no return
Sometimes they found it
Sometimes they kept it
Often lost in on the way
Pawnee shadow to possess him
Sometimes ride inside of day
Oh, the sad was in their eyes
And the desert that's dry
In a country town
Where the map was found
Oh, the sad was in their eye
And the desert that's dry
In a country town

Raining slapping on the window pane
An hour or more of teeming
Storm punching like a hurricane
That tore him out of dreaming
Air screaming through the slightest gap
Rattling between the frame and the sill
Drapes hanging from the final act
When I had you still

One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood hung of his lament
Dash him down on cold cement
One Bell Ringing

Flies buzzing round strip search light
They've got him down on his knees
He thinks of honey dripping from a spoon
Girls whispering in Portuguese
Between muzzle and the black site

Whatever happened to
Saturday Night
When you dressed up sharp
And you felt all right?

It don't seem the same
Since cosmic light
Came into my life
I thought I was divine

I used to go for a ride
With a chick who'd go
And listen to the music
On the radio

A saxophone was blowin'
On a rock 'n' roll show
You climbed in the back seat
Really had a good time

[Chorus]
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul

From the perfume I smelt
My hands kinda fumbled with her
White plastic belt

I'd taste her baby-pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine

Get back in front
Put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing
His very last song

With your arms around your girl
You try to sing along
You felt pretty good. Woo!
Really had a good time!

Trying to form the words that somehow
Might mean I am feeling

So many colors in this distraction
Brown hair makes her lips more red
Words would not describe what I'm seeing
I try to hold my tongue but it's useless

She makes my heart scream color
I know by now she should have found me out
And every sense I have's been exhausted
But color makes her smile

She's always waiting for me to speak
But all she hears is whitest noise
Though I may not communicate my heart
She knows the color I'm screaming

She makes my heart scream color
I know by now she should have found me out

No me digas nada, quédate callada
Dices que te vas y te vas y te vas, y aquí estás sentada
Ya me tienes harto, con tantas palabras
No hay necesidad que me cantes lo mismo cada mañana

Cuando quieras irte
Tú pones la fecha pa' despedirte
Yo no tengo pelos para decirte
Que espero que nunca regreses ya

Si te vas, no hay lío
Hay otra que quiere quitarme el frío
Tú ves por tu lado, yo por еl mío
Y así me dejas vivir en paz

Quе no te he querido, que no me has amado
Eso ya no importa, tu cumple con irte y todo arreglado
No tengas pendiente, yo nunca he llorado
Pues, gracias a Dios, en asuntos de amor, soy afortunado

Que le acompaña y le dice, ya esta bueno de licor
Nada remedia con llanto, nada remedia con vino

Y de su cortante filo que su boca destroso
Y la sangre que brotaba, confundiose con el vino
Y en la cantina este grito a todos estermeciò

No se apure que es que quiero con el filo de esta copa

Ted Leo & The Pharmacists,Army Bound,neg,"3 ContributorsArmy Bound LyricsSome modest dreams, they just don't pay out
Some modest means don't leave much way out
In every cradle there's a grave now
In every owner there's a slave now

Heard somewhere that there is a place now
Someone who'll catch you on your way down
But in every captain there's a kid now
In every chaplain there's an id now

So make sure you keep your bunk beds made
One day you'll see your bunker walls degrade
And in every garden there's a snake now
In every pardon there's mistake now

When you fall on the ground
Not a sound, army bound
When you're all no account
No amount, army bound

When your vests or your gowns
Hand-me-down, army bound
When what's next looks unsound
Shaky ground, army bound

Working hard for a round
To the crown, army bound
While you march from your town
To renown, army boundYou might also likeEmbed"

Twisted Sister,Burn In Hell,neg,"11 ContributorsBurn in Hell Lyrics[Verse 1]
Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in, child, take my hand
Here there's no work or play
Only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say
As you go down, down, down

[Chorus 1]
You're gonna burn in Hell
Oh, burn in Hell

[Verse 2]
You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying, I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire and I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn

[Chorus 2]
Before I burn in Hell
Oh, burn in Hell

[Verse 3]
Take one good look in your heart, tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now, for tomorrow may be far too late
You might also like[Chorus 3]
And then you'll burn in Hell (Hear no evil, don't you see no evil)
Oh, burn in Hell (Don't you lay no evil, down on me)
You're gonna burn in Hell (Speak no evil, don't you think no evil)
Oh, burn in hell (Don't you play with evil, 'cause I'm free)

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Hear no evil, don't you see no evil
Don't you lay no evil down on me
You're gonna burn in Hell
Speak no evil, don't you think no evil
Don't you play with evil, 'cause I'm free
You're gonna burn in Hell

Hear no evil, don't you see no evil
Don't you lay no evil down on me
You're gonna burn in Hell
Speak no evil, don't you think no evil
Don't you play with evil, 'cause I'm free
You're gonna burn in Hell

[Outro]
Hear no evil, don't you see no evil
Don't you lay no evil down on me
Oh, burn in Hell
You're gonna burn in Hell
Speak no evil, don't you think no evil
Don't you play with evil, 'cause I'm free
Oh, burn in Hell

Exodus,The Toxic Waltz,neg,"16 ContributorsThe Toxic Waltz Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

Here's a new dance craze that's sweepin' the nation
It's called the Toxic Waltz and it's causin' devastation
You're jumpin' up and down like a psycho circus clown
Slammin' with waltzers all the way around
You get caught up in the whip, you're thrown into a flip
Then you aim for someone's head to stain the floor red
Give someone a kick to prove you're truly sick
Bounce back from some blows and blood runs out your nose

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!
And this exercise helps you brutalise
With us! Exodus!

Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
You might also likeUsed to do the monkey, but now it's not cool
The twist and mashed potato are no exception to the rule
So don't be a dunce and dance like a runt
Just throw your elbows with good friendly, violent fun
Don't start to cry if you get a black eye
Just dive back in and give another try
But too much action may leave you in traction
So you better get insurance no matter your endurance

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!
And this exercise helps you brutalise
With us! Exodus!

Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
[Instrumental Break]

Get up on your feet
Don't look so obsolete
And thrash like an athlete!
Don't sit there on your ass
Don't look like you got too much class
You'll be harassed!
You know we guarantee
This is the key
So rage or get the third degree!
You begin frontal assaults
And start your somersaults
And do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!1Embed"

The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400-SE

A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concerned, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours, but...

You're sexiness and [?] makes me
Wanna cook my favorite recipe and place it on your table, baby
You're intoxicating and so divine
You're the kind that stays on a sista's mind
And I know you'll think this is crazy

[Chorus]
But I got something better at home
Ooh whoo oo woo woo
Hey hey, I got something better at home

[Verse]
He's the kind that breaks it down and curls my toes
Woo woo woo baby ow
He's the kind that loves my mind and feeds my soul
And I love it, baby
His intellect and outer respect makes me wanna crawl
And be my best and I know he loves his baby
He sense of self and silliness
Makes the hardest things the simplest
And I look, but don't touch
Never know, baby

You can rest your shoulders and sleep at night
Okay, alright

[Outro]
'Cause I know, 'cause I know know know
I know I got something better at home, whoo
I know I got something better at home
Oh oooh woo woo wooo
Alright alright, let's calm downEmbed"
Evile,Armoured Assault,neg,"2 ContributorsArmoured Assault LyricsThunder through the darkness
The curse of war has come
An armoured force invading
Serenities undone
Disciples of pure hatred
Like lightning they attack
The carry a torch of evil
The flame that burns black

Signed in blood
A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence
Armoured assault has begun

Cites burn in flames
Only ruins remain
Blood stains the earth
Defenders fight in vain
Crushing all before them
With metal armoured might
Futile prayers for mercy
Unanswered in the fight

Signed in blood
A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence
Armoured assault has begun

Leg devastation begin
The iron fist of evil
Condemns you and your kin
Destruction of subhuman race
Innocents shall die
The plague of war corrupts the earth
They’re fighting for a lie

Signed in blood
A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence
Armoured assault has begunEmbed"

(So, darling, I can dream on it too)

So, darling, I can dream on it too

I'll share your loving dreams that once were true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So, darling, I can dream on it too

Abysmal Dawn,The Descent,neg,"2 ContributorsThe Descent LyricsAs I breathe this cold that confines me
It is I who hopes to bring light
To this valley of death
Behind the shadow of lies

Brilliant beams converge now to blind me
I cannot feel shame nor regret
But in the presence of death
When the vultures arrive

Slaves, your time of descent will come with us all
Pain the way of all flesh that withers to old

All that you dream will be forgotten
And burn with the kindred of souls
I am the seed who has begotten
To rot with the waste of this earth down below
Now burn with the kindred of souls
Your hopes have now aged and withered away

All that you dream will be forgotten
And burn with the kindred of souls
I am the seed who has begotten

Ella Fitzgerald,Rocks In My Bed,pos,"2 ContributorsRocks In My Bed LyricsMy heart is heavy as lead
Because the blues has done spread
Rocks in my bed

Of all the people I see
Why do they pick on poor me
And put rocks in my bed

All night long I weep
So how can I sleep
With rocks in my bed

There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
That's a deceitful woman
And a hard faced man

She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back
She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back
She's lower than a snake down in a wagon track

To pain and fear he's no stranger
But his lust needs to satisfied
Hooked on an eight second ride

[Verse 2]
Gettin' up down in back of the chutes
Makes that rosin burn
He's got his spurs on the heels of his boots
He's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate he settles down inside
The tension's risin'
But he can't wait until they turn that bull outside

[Chorus]
He's addicted to danger
Ruled by passion and pride
To pain and fear he's no stranger
But his lust needs to satisfied

Brooks & Dunn,We'll Burn That Bridge,neg,"7 ContributorsWe’ll Burn That Bridge Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello Miss Heartbroke, sit your sweet self down
It's good to see your dancin' feet back out on the town
Rumor has it you've had trouble with your man
I've had trouble of my own, I think I understand

[Chorus]
We'll put out your old flame, we'll build a bigger fire
I'll pick up where he let you down and take you so much higher
And if his memory comes around and you think you still care
We'll burn that bridge when we get there

[Verse 2]
Come on, let your hair down, we'll have us a time
He had his chance with you, now all I want is mine
Give me half an hour or just a dance or two
And you'll forget old what's-his-name and how he walked out on you

[Chorus]
We'll put out your old flame, we'll build a bigger fire
I'll pick up where he let you down and take you so much higher
And if his memory comes around and you think you still care
We'll burn that bridge when we get there

[Chorus]
We'll put out your old flame, we'll build a bigger fire
I'll pick up where he let you down and take you so much higher
And if his memory comes around and you think you still care
We'll burn that bridge when we get there

The Ting Tings,That's Not My Name,neg,"41 ContributorsThat’s Not My Name Lyrics[Verse 1: Katie White]
Four-letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue
And I, I keep stallin', not keepin' it together
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Holdin' back, every day the same
Don't wanna be a loner, listen to me, oh, no
I never say anything at all
But with nothing to consider, they forget my name-ame-ame-ame

[Chorus: Katie White]
They call me ""hell""
They call me Stacey
They call me ""her""
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet
But I'm a riot

Always the same

I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standin' up against the wall
Keep fa-falling, these heels that keep me borin'
Gettin' clamped up and sittin' on the fence now
So alone all the time and I
Lock myself away, listen to me, oh, no
And though I'm dressed up, out and all
With everything considered, they forget my name-ame-ame-ame

[Chorus: Katie White, Jules De Martino]
They call me ""hell"" (This song was in my head)

Hey, baby boy, is your mama home?
Did she go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is she good to you?
Does she do to you things that I do?
I'm gonna take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my soul

And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire

Drills a tick-tock in my brain, digs canals across my face

When I hold the fury of the world
All the eyes of little girls will be flames that dance and swirl
And they'll melt you to your bones, char your eyes turn you to stone
And when the future finds you there and they stack you in the air

No love to spend on you
I can piss away my cash, my time I can't get back
And your face at night
Dances tick-tock on my brain, digs it's digits in my face

When I hold the fury of the world
All the eyes of little girls will be flames that dance and swirl
And they'll melt you to your bones, char your eyes turn you to stone
And when the future finds you there and they stack you in the air
I'll be there to burn down that skyscraper too

All my hate and my hexes are for you

Standing here in disarray
A calm serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide
Gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun

Surrounded by everything I want
But nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdities
Losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need
To find that road
Right around that curve a lesson learned
Now that I have the eyes to see

[Chorus]
A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

[Verse 2]
With poison toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treasure is
'Cause they only blocked my view

Got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone?

The carnage must be unimpeded
Blood and souls are what is needed
The killing goes on day and night
We'll never fill this hole

The Bloody Pit, it doesn't care
About the why, the when, the where
As guts are ripped and blood is spilled
It only knows it must be filled
And that's the way its always been
Never change, never win

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's make it clear
Just why we're here
It's for something more important
Thank for drinking all your beer
We're here to kill you
And claim your souls
And drape your stinking entrails round
Our numerous war-poles

Can't be called a crime
Happens every time
A gathering of ghouls
We fill the pit with blood and souls
This is the only rule
Zombies marching off to war
They've done it all before
A gathering of ghouls
Raping, slaying, heavily flaying
The Bloody Pit is pleased!
It's bursting with disease
A gathering of ghouls
Hacking and bashing
And selling drugs at school

[Breakdown]
They say that this world is going insane
But I care little, my zombies need brains
If we need more victims, we'll load them in trains

All is as it was and will be lots more

The bloody curse of warEmbed"

And life is not dying in this fight
I'm begging you to deliver me ooh ooh ooh
Confused why you won't take this pain from me

My steps never felt so hard
The end never look so far but
If you won't take me out
Then please take me through this

Stay with me so I won't leave
And make me see that this is not forever
'Cause all I need is your love pulling me

What is the reason for this night
Is hope found in fullness with no light
Does strength grow in our greatest fears
God I pray something good will come from this pain

God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
But it all disappears and then I wake up

Was it too late? Was it just your fate?
There's a demon that waits at the garden gate
If you get past him, maybe Lawrence and Phil
Will be waiting to take you to the ghost of rockschool

Everything hums as the blue heart turns
And the blue girl's dawn is when the sun goes down
My story tonight is from your solitude heights
I got a window on your constellation

Master I love from the ground above
As the stars below, as my memory flows
Every picture frame is beating louder than time
Every clock in the hall is bending slowly

She's in her tower and she's beautiful, sure
The quicker you learn she has no soul to discern
At least no business of yours, you bear the vacuum of scars
She was put there to tempt you like the perfume of flowers

God before bed and the promise of sleep

Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh

I can see it in his eyes (Oh I)
And he's been avoiding me all day
It seems as though he wants to cry, (Oh, I)
And he's been acting really strange
He starts talkin' and I tuned him out,yeah
It doesn't matter anyway
Because I knew as soon as I saw clouds, yeah
I knew what he was gonna say

[Chorus:]
Cause when the tears start flowin' and the wind starts blowin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you
When the rain start fallin' and you feel the pain comin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you

Just like a hurricane
Just like a hurricane
The way you break everything that comes in your way
Just like a hurricane
Just like a hurricane
The way you broke my heart and now I'm left with the pain
After the hurricane

And it hurts I ain't gon' lie

[Chorus:]
Cause when the tears start flowin' and the wind starts blowin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you
When the rain start fallin' and you feel the pain comin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you

The way you broke my heart and now I'm left with the pain
After the hurricane

[Verse 3:]
Now my life is shattered, and I'm left to pick up the pieces
And find a new beginning and put it back together again
After the hurricane, the hurricane

[Chorus:]
Cause when the tears start flowin' and the wind starts blowin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you
When the rain start fallin' and you feel the pain comin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you

Beres Hammond,Try If You Want,neg,"1 ContributorTry If You Want LyricsWooo, Yeah!

As poor as I am I've got my ambition
Keep my distance from war and contention
I might not be rich but I sure got style
Got some good friends
But still some who hate me
Tell their lies
And still that don't quake me
The joy thats inside
Brings out my healthy smile

Try if you want
Can't stop me
Lie if you want
Still won't move me
Won't move me
Nooo
Won't move me,at all.(x2)

I know who I am
I don't let nobody
Underestimate me and you'll end up sorry
The father will humble you like a child
Oh Yeah
I'm getting stronger
So much stronger
Day by day
I'm getting stronger
So much stronger
Can't move me
Can't move me
Nooo
You might also likeTry if you want
Can't stop me
Lie if you want
Still won't move me
Won't move me
Nooo
Won't move me,at all.(x2)

Amidst all the pressures
I've still got to make it
Always pushing
The sky is my limit
So keep your idle talk
I don't have the time
There's so much in life
If you're willing to earn it
I'll give you some of mine
But please don't stress it
Awake from the slumber
Open up your eyes

Try if you want
Can't stop me
Lie if you want
Still won't move me
Won't move me
Nooo
Won't move me,at all.(x2)
I'm getting stronger
So much stronger(stronger and stronger)
And you can't move me, no (can't move me,can't move me)

Poor as I am I've got my ambition
Keep my distance from war and contention
I might not be rich but I sure got style
Got some good friends
But still some who hate me
Tell their lies
And still that don't quake me
The joy thats inside
Brings out my healthy smile

John Pizzarelli,Happy Talk,pos,"1 ContributorHappy Talk LyricsHappy talk, keep talkin' happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You got to have a dream, if you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

Talk about the moon floatin' in the sky
Lookin' at a lily on the lake
Talk about a bird learnin' how to fly
Makin' all the music he can make

Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You got to have a dream, if you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

Talk about a boy sayin' to a girl
""Golly, baby, I'm a lucky 'cause""
Talk about the girl sayin' to the boy
""You and me is lucky to be us""

Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You got to have a dream, if you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

If you don't talk happy and you never have dream
Then you'll never have a dream come trueYou might also likeEmbed"

A simple remedy of walking into trees
Mistaking birds as bees

Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die?

Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind

As you savour the flavour of murder

El amor es besar poniendo el corazón
Es perdonarme tú y comprenderte yo
El amor es parar el tiempo en un reloj
Es buscar un lugar donde escuchar tu voz
El amor es crear un mundo entre los dos
Es perdonarme tú y comprenderte yo

[Verso 2]
El amor es una gota con sabor a miel
Es una lluvia en el atardecer
Es un paraguas para dos
El amor es un espacio donde no hay lugar
Para otra cosa que no sea amar
Es algo entre tú y yo

Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone
But watch it break when I get you alone
Take a chance, come lay down with me
Oh, I want to make it
Slow and steady never lost the race
Don't stop running, I'm a fool for the chase
Play the game, surrender to me
Baby, I don't want to fake it

You got me coming under fire?
Coming like thunder
You know you make me walk the wire

But my passion it won't slip away

Sink my teeth deep into you
Solemn oath of sheer destruction

Hope is swallowed up in pain
Taste the venom, feel the power
Coursing through my veins

Everything I did was wrong
And I found fault
In everyone but me

I was hurt and alone
I could not find my way home
Broke-down and hungry
And too tired to moan

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
A world of confusion

I was there by myself
Couldn't find no help no where else
Thought I'd call up the hotline
But there was nobody there

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed

[Verse 1: Tom Araya]
Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem, the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer, then move on ahead

[Chorus: Gene Hoglan & Tom Araya]

My words defy

Has no disguise

Will take your soul

My wrath unfolds

Guides us with every first step

Soon, there'll be nothing else left
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with God's angels and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can

A través de las persianas
De tu cuarto, de tu alma
Tú sientes como se filtra la nostalgia
Cuando cae la noche
Sobre tí, sobre tus hombros
Tú sabes como te duele estar aquí

[Puente 1]
Sin embargo
Ella está a tu lado
Un poco fría se volvió
Pero tú la estás amando

[Verso 2]
A través de las persianas
De tu mente, de tus recuerdos
Tú sientes como te oprimen esos sentimientos
Cuando cae el remordimiento
(Sobre ti, sobre tus manos)
Tú sabes como te duele haberlo hecho

Ella está a tu lado
Nunca solo te dejó
Ni por un instante
En tu cuarto
Desde que tu la hiciste sufrir
Por su cuello tu la hiciste morir
Y no pudo nada ya decir

El Padre Antonio Xejeira vino de España
Buscando nuevas promesas en ésta tierra
Llegó a la selva sin la esperanza de ser obispo
Y entre el calor y entre los mosquitos habló de Cristo
El padre no funcionaba en el Vaticano
Entre papeles y sueños de aire acondicionado
Y fue a un pueblito, en medio e' la nada
A dar su sermón, cada semana, pa' los que busquen la salvación

El niño Andrés Eloy Pérez tiene 10 años
Y estudia en la elementaria ""Simón Bolívar""
Todavía no sabe decir el Credo correctamente
Le gusta el río, jugar al fútbol y estar ausente
Le han dado el puesto en la Iglesia de monaguillo
A ver si la conexión compone al chiquillo
Y su familia está muy orgullosa, porque a su vez se cree que
Con Dios conectando a uno, conecta a diez
Suenan la campanas, un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés
Suenan la campanas, un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés

El Padre condena la violencia
Sabe por experiencia que no es la solución
Les habla de amor y de justicia
De Dios va la noticia vibrando en su sermón
Suenan las campanas, un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés
Suenan las campanas otra vez

Enslaved by warlords from far away lands
Forced into a life of slavery
Forced to fight your brothers for rulers so cruel
A killer instinct your only escape
Ferocious battle, you must fight to survive
Each weapon an extension of your strength
All victories add greatness to your name
Fight to the death, there will be no surrender
Your cunning must be afforded
There will be no remorse for those who gamble with your fate
Freedom, through killing strangers will it come
You fight to live, freedom gained with every shiv
You need to prove, prove your worth
To ascend to the trial of champions
Every fight a battle to the death
Your fate lies in the hands of fools
A meager wager more precious than your life
When the thumb comes down
You know just what to do

And there's more hardtimes than on Good Times
And most niggas dedicate their life to crime

In the middle of my life, I had nothing to lose
No one to love, now it's you I'm thinking of
You're a little of heaven to me
You're all I need, it's my concern
There's a lesson to be learned
I thought I had the whole world at my feet
Now I know
That I was dreaming
I fooled around and lost the only one made for me
And now I'm sorry, oh so sorry

This heart of mine has to live a second time
Take a little of your love from me

Stars can't fight city lights
They've turned their backs on us
It's true today, I saw it from the plane
Aeroplanes were never built to fly

Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Don't look down
Don't look now

Crosshairs of our shadow trace the dam
Told that there were people trapped alive
Boulder City looks like coals in the fire

Cabin's perched by satellites
And now we're flying blind
We've got a lady pilot
She's not afraid to die

It's true today, I saw it from the plane
We've almost finished reeling in the sky

A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 3]
It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word ""fresh"" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it
[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?

The light you barely see
Growing wings of sorrow
Have brought you to the winds of plague
Increscent boundaries fade the way
A barren future all too real
And still I try to seek up and find the flame
And still I try inside
It's endless

A barren future all too real
And still I try

Iron Maiden,Fear Of The Dark,neg,"44 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFear of the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night, or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 2]
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around, and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 4]
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Grab your gun, time to go to hell

I'm no Jesus, but neither are you my friend

Sold my soul, to heaven and to hell
Sick as my secrets, but never gonna tell

The Telkhine wizards met
On the peat of Mt. Cithren
They vowed malevolence
The call for death was sent
To command all earth and men
Behead the mega priest
Bring hell unto the streets
I hear voices
Make me kill
I hear voices
Make me kill

On the wings of malcontent
Another billion dead
Upon your bated breath

Our fists raised to the sky
As we watch the Goddess die

Make me kill

Jimmy Ruffin,I've Passed This Way Before,neg,"4 ContributorsI’ve Passed This Way Before LyricsLife lends a crushing blow
And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats itself
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me

A dark cloud covered my heart
Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

No matter how strong a man is
Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart
You might also likeA lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Because I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart againEmbed"
