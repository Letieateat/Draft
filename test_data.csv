They can hate if they wanna
I don't care, yeah

Goin' nowhere
(What you know about a stereotype? Hey)
They can hate if they wanna
Let them hate if they wanna
Goin' nowhere

[Verse 1]
Mmm, all your friends keep sayin' you can do better
With somebody else (Hey, come on)
Sayin' I'm dangerous and you can do bad
All by yourself (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Everybody got somethin' to say)
And they don't even wanna see
While they talk so badly
I actually make you happy
(All that matter is us anyway)
And I don't even give a damn
For you I'm a better man
So tell 'em, if they wanna hate, they can

And the life I live
You ain't out in the club all night
You wanna be the quiet part of my life
They don't understand how beautiful that is, hey, hey

(Everybody got somethin' to say)

I'll never turn you down

So don't hold on too tightly

[Verse 1]
Happier now than I've been in the past
Gone are the days
Gone are the tears

The girl that you now see standing in front of you
Could keep going on
Because she believes
In setting you free

Yo, this one here
Goes out to all my players out there, man, you know
That got that one good girl, dawg, that's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave

[Verse 1: Akon]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so

Until the colour of a man's skin

Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race

Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued

Shake your rattle-snake skin
And become a part of society
Wait on down the highway
To see how far I'll come a-run a-run
Run running
All that we had salvaged from the fire
Was a waste of time
(But) what a waste of time

Should I trust all the rust that's on TV
I guess with some distaste I disagree
With quite a fashionable dispassion for
The dispossessed under-stressed
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
And I don't care if you don't like it
Or just don't see

Now that we fattened the cow
And set out to plow unknown enemies

""How now did you see what I did see?""
The ravaged cabbage drifts on dark red skies
And it looks so nice
Gee it looks so nice

What do you know about love
It's just a test
It ain't your life
Tell me...

Talk about love
That's all I want you to do

I'd like to give you a test
So, darling, prepare yourself

What pictures pop in your brain

'Cause when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
Say when you think about love (Love, love, love)
Ooo, when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
You should be talking 'bout me (Love, love, love)

Now if you need to be taught
Don't make me an afterthought
For every lesson that's wrong
You can bet my good lovin' will be gone
So let's erase any doubt
Take a second or two to figure out
Speak from your lips to my ears

It's so hard not to feel ashamed
Of the loving, living games we play each day

And I'm stuck in a shack down the back of the sea
Oh, and I'm alive and I'm alone inside a sick, sick dream
Oh, is it me, is it me that feels so weak?
I cannot deceive but I find it hard to speak

I'm a wanderin fool burnin fossil fuel
Sending arrows into the dark
But I'm just lookin for a place where I can fall apart

Throw all of my junk into the Alamo trunk
And I pull out into the lane
Cell phone's dead there's mountains ahead
I don't even slow down for the rain
There was a time when the road was mine
And the path was lined with sparks
Now I'm just lookin for a place where I can fall apart

It's in the air the scent of despair
Nobody wants to talk about it
We're all scared we're gonna lose our share of the dream
Can't live without it

My clothes are funky I'm a sugar junkie
I'm a promo monkey in a cage
I lunge for the carrot repeat like a parrot
Til I step out onto the stage

Shinin through the dark
And I'm just lookin for a place where I can fall apart

Addicted to a natural high
Don't know why it's appealin'

Gettin' up down in back of the chutes
Makes that rosin burn
He's got his spurs on the heels of his boots
He's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate he settles down inside
The tension's risin'
But he can't wait until they turn that bull outside

Cyndi Lauper,Time After Time,neg,"Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say, ""go slow""
And I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside (deep inside)
And the drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

It is I who hopes to bring light
To this valley of death
Behind the shadow of lies

Brilliant beams converge now to blind me
I cannot feel shame nor regret
But in the presence of death
When the vultures arrive

Slaves, your time of descent will come with us all
Pain the way of all flesh that withers to old

All that you dream will be forgotten
And burn with the kindred of souls
I am the seed who has begotten
To rot with the waste of this earth down below
Now burn with the kindred of souls
Your hopes have now aged and withered away

Rolling her homeward
With blood on our knives
Who'd have known, you’re a deviant sister
Guts on your blouse
You’re worth your own weight

In diamonds, a dozen
Sailing to nowhere
Vapor to float on
Still we roll on through the night

Battle systems, trading in lies
Taken down by the hounds, one by one
Longing to find our way out
Following the ghost down

Running in circles, a mouse on the table
I try to feel but just don’t
Curling and dead inside

The first crystal tears fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain

Here's a new dance craze that's sweepin' the nation
It's called the Toxic Waltz and it's causin' devastation
You're jumpin' up and down like a psycho circus clown
Slammin' with waltzers all the way around
You get caught up in the whip, you're thrown into a flip
Then you aim for someone's head to stain the floor red
Give someone a kick to prove you're truly sick
Bounce back from some blows and blood runs out your nose

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!
And this exercise helps you brutalise
With us! Exodus!

Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
You might also likeUsed to do the monkey, but now it's not cool
The twist and mashed potato are no exception to the rule
So don't be a dunce and dance like a runt
Just throw your elbows with good friendly, violent fun
Don't start to cry if you get a black eye
Just dive back in and give another try
But too much action may leave you in traction
So you better get insurance no matter your endurance

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!

That’s in your hand
And the murder in front of you
Send out the wolves
The King is dead

This means war
Did the sun just burn out
Leaving you all alone

Living in a wicked world
We’re living in a wicked world
There’s no way you will escape
No one ever gets away

Love was the fuel
That drove your sin
When the Majesty followed you
The witches dance
The night begins
And the heart's taking over

The Royalty won’t wash away
It’s his scent that's inside of you
Off with her head
The Queen, she screams

Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

At puberty they paid their dues
The pool hall was the Moulin Rouge

And he likes her skirt
And she like his tight levi's
Fannin' flames of the fire
That burned higher than the fire in their eyes

A pinch from Mama's treasure chest

And some people's kids don't know how fast time flies
Now they're payin' for the fire burnin' higher than the fire in their eyes

Some people's kids can't see

Is someone to be there
To love 'em and to care, about them

And while we were making love, I saw visions of a tropical river

Last night you brought my dreams to reality

Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings
Last night, I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing
Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony
While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free

And we're calling for your souls

The carnage must be unimpeded
Blood and souls are what is needed
The killing goes on day and night
We'll never fill this hole

About the why, the when, the where
As guts are ripped and blood is spilled
It only knows it must be filled
And that's the way its always been
Never change, never win

Dark is the light, the man you fight with all your prayers, incantations
Running away, a trivial day of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold this bounty soul, a gentile or a priest?
Who victored over the Seljuks when the holy land was taken?

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Was it the riches of the land, powers of bright darkness
That lead the nobles to the East to fight the heathens

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

[Post-Chorus]
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it
No International security, no call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill a man, history teaches us so
The reason he must attain must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war

Born again with eyes for war

I wake to the sound of souls at war
I will pass through
Buried with the flag of my war

There was nothing I could miss

I had found the one before
I even knew her name
I was sure that when she left me
I would never feel the same
It was easy

What did I get myself into
I didn't realize the compromise
I put you through What did

I was sure it'd last forever

Bloc Party,Like Eating Glass,neg,"28 ContributorsLike Eating Glass Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's so cold in this house
Open mouth swallowing us
The children sent home from school
Will not stop crying
And I know that you're busy, do I know that you care?
You got your finger on the pulse, you got your eyes everywhere
And it hurts all the time when you don't return my calls
And you haven't got the time to remember how it was
It's so cold in this house
It's so cold in this house

[Verse 2]
I can't eat, I can't sleep
I can't sleep, I can't dream
An aversion to light
Got a fear of the ocean

[Chorus]
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating

[Verse 3]
It's so cold in this house
It's so cold in this house
It's so cold in this house
It's so cold in this bed

[Bridge]
Oh!
Woo!
C-c-c-come, show me
How, how it was

[Outro]
We got crosses on our eyes
Been walking into the walls again
We got crosses on our eyes
Been walking into the furniture
We got crosses on our eyes
For richer, for poorer, for better, for worse
We got crosses on our eyes
We've been walking into the furniture9Embed"

Bob Marley & The Wailers,So Much Trouble In The World,neg,"20 ContributorsSo Much Trouble in the World Lyrics[Intro]
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world

[Verse 1]
Bless my eyes this morning
Jah sun is on the rise once again
The way earthly thing's are going
Anything can happen
You see men sailing on their ego trip
Blast off on their spaceship
Million miles from reality
No care for you, no care for me

[Verse 2]
So much trouble in the world;
So much trouble in the world
All you got to do: give a little (give a little)
Give a little (give a little), give a little (give a little)!
One more time, ye-ah! (give a little) Ye-ah! (give a little)
Ye-ah! (give a little) Yeah!

[Verse 3]
So you think you've found the solution
But it's just another illusion!
(So before you check out this tide)
Don't leave another cornerstone
Standing there behind, eh-eh-eh-eh!
We've got to face the day
(Ooh) Ooh-wee, come what may
We the street people talking
Yeah, we the people struggling

Tokyo Police Club,Big Difference,neg,"5 ContributorsBig Difference LyricsThe quiet kid is coming to stay
What did he say?
He says I'm lonely
Says I'm lonely

I'll tell you everything I know
What do you know?
He says I'm hopeless
Says I'm hopeless

And that's why I can't send you Christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and more exclamation marks

The little king is locked away
Swallowed the key
He says it's alright
But I'm not sorry

I'll tell you everything I saw
What did you see?
A hundred and one
He says it's alright
But I know what I've done

[Chorus]
And that's why I can't send you Christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and so
You might also likeCharmed but destroyed
Opens up the window
Bored and overwhelmed
I was overwhelmed

But that's the best part
That's the best part
[/Chorus]

Cause I've been taking your advice
Like a Speak and Spell
And I could get to know you better
And never know you well

Alabama,Down Home,pos,"4 ContributorsDown Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on a state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die
Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in the rat race
And these days, that's a special way of life

(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

[Verse 2]
In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered 'round a checker board
Old men tellin' lies and crownin' kings
Kids drivin' 'round the old town square
Cops roll down in the cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen

(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

Those of us raised up
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is all your love?)
Where is the love?

[Verse 1: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
Where is the love
You said you'd give to me soon as you were free?
Will it ever be?
Where is the love?

[Refrain: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
You told me that you didn't love him
And you were gonna say goodbye
But if you really didn't mean it
Why did you have to lie?

[Verse 2: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
Where is the love
You said was mine all mine, 'til the end of time?
Was it just a lie?
Where is the love?

[Refrain: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't leave me hangin' on the promises
You've got to let me know

Wait (That's all I can do, yeah, yeah, yeah)
